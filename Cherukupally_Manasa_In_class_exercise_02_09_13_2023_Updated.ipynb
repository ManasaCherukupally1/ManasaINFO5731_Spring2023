To address this, and to facilitate researchers to broadly evaluate the effectiveness of their models, we introduce Benchmarking-IR (BEIR), a robust and heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for information retrieval. We leverage a careful selection of 18 publicly available datasets from diverse text retrieval tasks and domains and evaluate 10 state-of-the-art retrieval systems including lexical, sparse, dense, late-interaction and re-ranking architectures on the BEIR benchmark. Our results show BM25 is a robust baseline and re-ranking and late-interaction-based models on average achieve the best zero-shot performances, however, at high computational costs. In contrast, dense and sparse-retrieval models are computationally more efficient but often underperform other approaches, highlighting the considerable room for improvement in their generalization capabilities. We hope this framework allows us to better evaluate and understand existing retrieval systems, and contributes to accelerating progress towards better robust and generalizable systems in the future.

Our toolkit is self-contained as a standard Python package and comes with queries, relevance judgments, pre-built indexes, and evaluation scripts for many commonly used IR test collections. We aim to support, out of the box, the entire research lifecycle of efforts aimed at improving ranking with modern neural approaches. In particular, Pyserini supports sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25 scoring using bag-of-words representations), dense retrieval (e.g., nearest-neighbor search on transformer-encoded representations), as well as hybrid retrieval that integrates both approaches. This paper provides an overview of toolkit features and presents empirical results that illustrate its effectiveness on two popular ranking tasks.

This makes it challenging for search engines to predict possible intents, only one of which may pertain to the current user. To address this issue, search engines often diversify the result list and present documents relevant to multiple intents of the query. An alternative approach is to ask the user a question to clarify her information need. Asking clarifying questions is particularly important for scenarios with “limited bandwidth” interfaces, such as speech-only and small-screen devices. In addition, our user studies and large-scale online experiments show that asking clarifying questions is also useful in web search. Although some recent studies have pointed out the importance of asking clarifying questions, generating them for open-domain search tasks remains unstudied and is the focus of this paper. Lack of training data even within major search engines for this task makes it challenging. To mitigate this issue, we first identify a taxonomy of clarification for open-domain search queries by analyzing large-scale query reformulation data sampled from Bing search logs. This taxonomy leads us to a set of question templates and a simple yet effective slot filling algorithm. We further use this model as a source of weak supervision to automatically generate clarifying questions for training. Furthermore, we propose supervised and reinforcement learning models for generating clarifying questions learned from weak supervision data. We also investigate methods for generating candidate answers for each clarifying question, so users can select from a set of pre-defined answers.

This has been accompanied by an expansion in the range of methodological approaches and types of review. However, there remains uncertainty over definitions and search requirements beyond those for the 'traditional' systematic review. This study aims to characterise health related reviews by type and to provide recommendations on appropriate methods of information retrieval based on the available guidance.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nA list of review types was generated from published typologies and categorised into 'families' based on their common features. Guidance on information retrieval for each review type was identified by searching pubmed, medline and Google Scholar, supplemented by scrutinising websites of review producing organisations.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nForty-eight review types were identified and categorised into seven families. Published guidance reveals increasing specification of methods for information retrieval; however, much of it remains generic with many review types lacking explicit requirements for the identification of evidence.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nDefining review types and utilising appropriate search methods remain challenging. By familiarising themselves with a range of review methodologies and associated search methods, information specialists will be better equipped to select suitable approaches for future projects.\", 'venue': 'Health Information and Libraries Journal', 'year': 2019, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35333489', 'name': 'A.

We propose a game theoretical minimax game to iteratively optimise both models. On one hand, the discriminative model, aiming to mine signals from labelled and unlabelled data, provides guidance to train the generative model towards fitting the underlying relevance distribution over documents given the query. On the other hand, the generative model, acting as an attacker to the current discriminative model, generates difficult examples for the discriminative model in an adversarial way by minimising its discrimination objective. With the competition between these two models, we show that the unified framework takes advantage of both schools of thinking: (i) the generative model learns to fit the relevance distribution over documents via the signals from the discriminative model, and (ii) the discriminative model is able to exploit the unlabelled data selected by the generative model to achieve a better estimation for document ranking.

Most open-source toolkits developed by academics are designed to facilitate the evaluation of retrieval models over standard test collections. Efforts are generally directed toward better ranking and less attention is usually given to scalability and other operational considerations. On the other hand, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications (outside a small number of companies that deploy custom infrastructure). Compared to academic IR toolkits, Lucene can handle heterogeneous web collections at scale, but lacks systematic support for evaluation over standard test collections. This paper introduces Anserini, a new information retrieval toolkit that aims to provide the best of both worlds, to better align information retrieval practice and research. Anserini provides wrappers and extensions on top of core Lucene libraries that allow researchers to use more intuitive APIs to accomplish common research tasks. Our initial efforts have focused on three functionalities: scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and an extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box.

Existing deep IR models such as DSSM and CDSSM directly apply neural networks to generate ranking scores, without explicit understandings of the relevance. According to the human judgement process, a relevance label is generated by the following three steps: 1) relevant locations are detected; 2) local relevances are determined; 3) local relevances are aggregated to output the relevance label. In this paper we propose a new deep learning architecture, namely DeepRank, to simulate the above human judgment process. Firstly, a detection strategy is designed to extract the relevant contexts. Then, a measure network is applied to determine the local relevances by utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) or two-dimensional gated recurrent units (2D-GRU). Finally, an aggregation network with sequential integration and term gating mechanism is used to produce a global relevance score. DeepRank well captures important IR characteristics, including exact/semantic matching signals, proximity heuristics, query term importance, and diverse relevance requirement.

Traditional learning to rank models employ machine learning techniques over hand-crafted IR features. By contrast, neural models learn representations of language from raw text that can bridge the gap between query and document vocabulary. Unlike classical IR models, these new machine learning based approaches are data-hungry, requiring large scale training data before they can be deployed. This tutorial introduces basic concepts and intuitions behind neural IR models, and places them in the context of traditional retrieval models. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts of IR and different neural and non-neural approaches to learning vector representations of text. We then review shallow neural IR methods that employ pre-trained neural term embeddings without learning the IR task end-to-end. We introduce deep neural networks next, discussing popular deep architectures. Finally, we review the current DNN models for information retrieval.

The problem setup includes a database of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula> independent messages possibly replicated on several servers, and a user that needs to retrieve one of these messages. In addition, the user has some prior side information in the form of a subset of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> messages, not containing the desired message and unknown to the servers. This problem is motivated by practical settings in which the user can obtain side information opportunistically from other users or has previously downloaded some messages using classical PIR schemes. The objective of the user is to retrieve the required message with downloading minimum amount of data from the servers while achieving information-theoretic privacy in one of the following two scenarios: (i) the user wants to protect jointly the identities of the demand and the side information; (ii) the user wants to protect only the identity of the demand, but not necessarily the side information. To highlight the role of side information, we focus first on the case of a single server (single database). In the first scenario, we prove that the minimum download cost is <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K-M$ </tex-math></inline-formula> messages, and in the second scenario it is <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\\\lceil K/(M+1)\\\\rceil $ </tex-math></inline-formula> messages, which should be compared to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula> messages—the minimum download cost in the case of no side information.

It is the first part of the development of a labor theoretic approach to information retrieval. Existing models for evaluation of information retrieval systems are reviewed and the distinction of operational from experimental systems partly dissolved. The often covert, but powerful, influence from technology on practice and theory is rendered explicit. Selection power is understood as the human ability to make informed choices between objects or representations of objects and is adopted as the primary value for information retrieval. Selection power is conceived as a property of human consciousness, which can be assisted or frustrated by system design. The concept of selection power is further elucidated, and its value supported, by an example of the discrimination enabled by index descriptions, the discovery of analogous concepts in partly independent scholarly and wider public discourses, and its embodiment in the design and use of systems. Selection power is regarded as produced by selection labor, with the nature of that labor changing with different historical conditions and concurrent information technologies. Selection labor can itself be decomposed into description and search labor. Selection labor, and its decomposition into description and search labor, will be treated in a subsequent paper, in a further development of a labor theoretic approach to information retrieval.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2016, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2239014085', 'name': 'Julian Warner'}]}\n",

The proposed LSTM-RNN model sequentially takes each word in a sentence, extracts its information, and embeds it into a semantic vector. Due to its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model is found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and detect the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords are found to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many different applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document retrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform several existing state of the art methods. We emphasize that the proposed model generates sentence embedding vectors that are specially useful for web document retrieval tasks.

Classic cPIR protocols require that the database server executes an algorithm over all the database content at very low speeds which impairs their usage. In [1], given certain assumptions, realistic at the time, Sion and Carbunar showed that cPIR schemes were not practical and most likely would never be. To this day, this conclusion is widely accepted by researchers and practitioners. Using the paradigm shift introduced by lattice-based cryptography, we show that the conclusion of Sion and Carbunar is not valid anymore: cPIR is of practical value. This is achieved without compromising security, using standard crytosystems, and conservative parameter choices.', 'venue': 'Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies', 'year': 2016, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1681525', 'name': 'C.

Finally, a non-linear transformation is applied to extract high-level semantic information to generate a continuous vector representation for the full text string.

QAC helps users to formulate their query when they have an intent in mind but not a clear way of expressing this in a query. It helps to avoid possible spelling mistakes, especially on devices with small screens. It saves keystrokes and cuts down the search duration of users which implies a lower load on the search engine, and results in savings in machine resources and maintenance. Because of the clear benets of QAC, a considerable number of algorithmic approaches to QAC have been proposed in the past few years. Query logs have proven to be a key asset underlying most of the recent research. This monograph surveys this research. It focuses on summarizing the literature on QAC and provides a general understanding of the wealth of QAC approaches that are currently available. A Survey of Query Auto Completion in Information Retrieval is an ideal reference on the topic. Its contributions can be summarized as follows: It provides researchers who are working on query auto completion or related problems in the eld of information retrieval with a good overview and analysis of state-of-the-art QAC approaches. In particular, for researchers new to the eld, the survey can serve as an introduction to the state-of-the-art.

It involves fielding the information retrieval system to real users, and observing these users' interactions in-situ while they engage with the system. This allows actual users with real world information needs to play an important part in assessing retrieval quality. As such, online evaluation complements the common alternative offline evaluation approaches which may provide more easily interpretable outcomes, yet are often less realistic when measuring of quality and actual user experience.In this survey, we provide an overview of online evaluation techniques for information retrieval. We show how online evaluation is used for controlled experiments, segmenting them into experiment designs that allow absolute or relative quality assessments. Our presentation of different metrics further partitions online evaluation based on different sized experimental units commonly of interest: documents, lists and sessions. Additionally, we include an extensive discussion of recent work on data re-use, and experiment estimation based on historical data.A substantial part of this work focuses on practical issues: How to run evaluations in practice, how to select experimental parameters, how to take into account ethical considerations inherent in online evaluations, and limitations that experimenters should be aware of. While most published work on online experimentation today is at large scale in systems with millions of users, we also emphasize that the same techniques can be applied at small scale.

In particular, we construct a generalized language model, where the mutual independence between a pair of words (say t and t') no longer holds. Instead, we make use of the vector embeddings of the words to derive the transformation probabilities between words. Specifically, the event of observing a term t in the query from a document d is modeled by two distinct events, that of generating a different term t', either from the document itself or from the collection, respectively, and then eventually transforming it to the observed query term t. The first event of generating an intermediate term from the document intends to capture how well does a term contextually fit within a document, whereas the second one of generating it from the collection aims to address the vocabulary mismatch problem by taking into account other related terms in the collection.

Despite these promising results, there has been little analysis of the use of these word embeddings for retrieval. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we set out to determine how these word embeddings can be used within a retrieval model and what the benefit might be. To this aim, we use neural word embeddings within the well known translation language model for information retrieval. This language model captures implicit semantic relations between the words in queries and those in relevant documents, thus producing more accurate estimations of document relevance. The word embeddings used to estimate neural language models produce translations that differ from previous translation language model approaches; differences that deliver improvements in retrieval effectiveness.

The literature on PIR considers only replication-based systems, wherein each storage node stores a copy of the entire data. However, systems based on erasure codes are gaining increasing popularity due to a variety of reasons. This paper initiates an investigation into PIR in erasure-coded systems by establishing its capacity and designing explicit codes and algorithms. The notion of privacy considered here is information-theoretic, and the metric optimized is the amount of data downloaded by the user during PIR. In this paper, we present four main results. First, we design an explicit erasure code and PIR algorithm that requires only one extra bit of download to provide perfect privacy. In contrast, all existing PIR algorithms require a download of at least twice the size of the requisite data. Second, we derive lower bounds proving the necessity of downloading at least one additional bit. This establishes the precise capacity of PIR with respect to the metric of download. These results are also applicable to PIR in replication-based systems, which are a special case of erasure codes. Our third contribution is a negative result showing that capacity-achieving codes necessitate super-linear storage overheads. This motivates the fourth contribution of this paper: an erasure code and PIR algorithm that requires a linear storage overhead, provides high reliability to the data, and is a small factor away from the capacity.', 'venue': '2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory', 'year': 2014, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1737249', 'name': 'Nihar B.

Examples include question answering systems and dialogue systems, voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like Facebook's Graph Search or Google's Knowledge Graph. However the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter counterparts. Thus, effective handling of verbose queries has become a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in this new breed of search applications. Over the past decade, the information retrieval community has deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion, reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations. However, thus far, there was not a coherent and organized tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list various application scenarios where effective verbose query processing can make a significant difference.\", 'venue': 'Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2015, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46722320', 'name': 'Manish Gupta'}, {'authorId': '1815447', 'name': 'Michael Bendersky'}]}\n",

AQE has a long history in the information retrieval community but it is only in the last years that it has reached a level of scientific and experimental maturity, especially in laboratory settings such as TREC. This survey presents a unified view of a large number of recent approaches to AQE that leverage various data sources and employ very different principles and techniques. The following questions are addressed. Why is query expansion so important to improve search effectiveness? What are the main steps involved in the design and implementation of an AQE component?

The tutorial is structured into two sessions. During the first session, we will explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. We will begin with temporal indexing and query processing. Next step, we will explain current approaches to time-aware retrieval and ranking, which can be classified into different types based on two main notions of relevance with respect to time, namely, recency-based ranking, and time-dependent ranking. In the latter session, we will describe research issues centered on determining the temporal intent of queries, and time-aware query enhancement, e.g., temporal relevance feedback, and time-aware query reformulation. In addition, we present applications in related research areas, e.g., exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction.

To address this, natural language information retrieval techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential faulty source files given bug reports. While these techniques are very scalable, in practice their effectiveness remains low in accurately localizing bugs to a small number of files. Our key insight is that structured information retrieval based on code constructs, such as class and method names, enables more accurate bug localization. We present BLUiR, which embodies this insight, requires only the source code and bug reports, and takes advantage of bug similarity data if available. We build BLUiR on a proven, open source IR toolkit that anyone can use. Our work provides a thorough grounding of IR-based bug localization research in fundamental IR theoretical and empirical knowledge and practice.

Such content creates a monolingual or multi-lingual space with more than one script which we refer to as the Mixed-Script space. IR in the mixed-script space is challenging because queries written in either the native or the Roman script need to be matched to the documents written in both the scripts. Moreover, transliterated content features extensive spelling variations. In this paper, we formally introduce the concept of Mixed-Script IR, and through analysis of the query logs of Bing search engine, estimate the prevalence and thereby establish the importance of this problem. We also give a principled solution to handle the mixed-script term matching and spelling variation where the terms across the scripts are modelled jointly in a deep-learning architecture and can be compared in a low-dimensional abstract space. We present an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed method along with the evaluation results in an ad-hoc retrieval setting of mixed-script IR where the proposed method achieves significantly better results (12% increase in MRR and 29% increase in MAP) compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2014, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40243462', 'name': 'Parth Gupta'}, {'authorId': '3086996', 'name': 'Kalika Bali'}, {'authorId': '50749348', 'name': 'R.

Leakage to E is to be confined to well-defined forms of data-access and query patterns while preventing disclosure of explicit data and query plaintext values. Recently, Cash et al. presented a protocol, OXT, which can run arbitrary boolean queries in the SSE setting and which is remarkably efficient even for very large databases. In this paper we investigate a richer setting in which the data owner D outsources its data to a server E but D is now interested to allow clients (third parties) to search the database such that clients learn the information D authorizes them to learn but nothing else while E still does not learn about the data or queried values as in the basic SSE setting. Furthermore, motivated by a wide range of applications, we extend this model and requirements to a setting where, similarly to private information retrieval, the client's queried values need to be hidden also from the data owner D even though the latter still needs to authorize the query. Finally, we consider the scenario in which authorization can be enforced by the data owner D without D learning the policy, a setting that arises in court-issued search warrants. We extend the OXT protocol of Cash et al. to support arbitrary boolean queries in all of the above models while withstanding adversarial non-colluding servers (D and E) and arbitrarily malicious clients, and while preserving the remarkable performance of the protocol.\", 'venue': 'IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive', 'year': 2013, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1720978', 'name': 'Stanislaw Jarecki'}, {'authorId': '2878366', 'name': 'C.

But what does it mean to be successful? It might refer to whether an information retrieval system retrieves relevant (compared with non-relevant) documents; how quickly results are returned; how well the system supports users' interactions; whether users are satisfied with the results; how easily users can use the system; whether the system helps users carry out their tasks and fulfil their information needs; whether the system impacts on the wider environment; how reliable the system is etc. Evaluation of information retrieval systems has been actively researched for over 50 years and continues to be an area of discussion and controversy. \\n \\nTest collections - In this paper we discuss system-oriented evaluation that focuses on measuring system effectiveness: how well an information retrieval system can separate relevant from non-relevant documents for a given user query. We discuss the construction and use of standardised benchmarks - test collections - for evaluating information retrieval systems. \\n \\nResearch directions - The paper also describes current and future research directions for test collection-based evaluation, including efficient gathering of relevance assessments, the relationship between system effectiveness and user utility, and evaluation across user sessions. \\n \\nConclusions - This paper describes test collections which have been widely used in information retrieval evaluation and provide an approach for measuring system effectiveness.\", 'venue': 'Information Research', 'year': 2013, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1704149', 'name': 'Paul D.

The goal of VIR is to retrieve the highest number of relevant matches to a given query (often expressed as an example image and/or a series of keywords). In its early years (1995-2000) the research efforts were dominated by content-based approaches contributed primarily by the image and video processing community. During the past decade, it was widely recognized that the challenges imposed by the semantic gap (the lack of coincidence between an image's visual contents and its semantic interpretation) required a clever use of textual metadata (in addition to information extracted from the image's pixel contents) to make image and video retrieval solutions efficient and effective. The need to bridge (or at least narrow) the semantic gap has been one of the driving forces behind current VIR research. Additionally, other related research problems and market opportunities have started to emerge, offering a broad range of exciting problems for computer scientists and engineers to work on. In this tutorial, we present an overview of visual information retrieval (VIR) concepts, techniques, algorithms, and applications. Several topics are supported by examples written in Java, using Lucene (an open-source Java-based indexing and search implementation) and LIRE (Lucene Image REtrieval), an open-source Java-based library for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) written by Mathias Lux.\\n After motivating the topic, we briefly review the fundamentals of information retrieval, present the most relevant and effective visual descriptors currently used in VIR, the most common indexing approaches for visual descriptors, the most prominent machine learning techniques used in connection with contemporary VIR solutions, as well as the challenges associated with building real-world, large scale VIR solutions, including a brief overview of publicly available datasets used in worldwide challenges, contests, and benchmarks. Throughout the tutorial, we integrate examples using LIRE, whose main features and design principles are also discussed. Finally, we conclude the tutorial with suggestions for deepening the knowledge in the topic, including a brief discussion of the most relevant advances, open challenges, and promising opportunities in VIR and related areas.\\n The tutorial is primarily targeted at experienced Information Retrieval researchers and practitioners interested in extending their knowledge of document-based IR to equivalent concepts, techniques, and challenges in VIR. The acquired knowledge should allow participants to derive insightful conclusions and promising avenues for further investigation.\", 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2013, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1786883', 'name': 'M.

The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and to then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A central issue in language model estimation is smoothing, the problem of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to compensate for data sparseness. In this article, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections. Experimental results show that not only is the retrieval performance generally sensitive to the smoothing parameters, but also the sensitivity pattern is affected by the query type, with performance being more sensitive to smoothing for verbose queries than for keyword queries. Verbose queries also generally require more aggressive smoothing to achieve optimal performance. This suggests that smoothing plays two different role---to make the estimated document language model more accurate and to \"explain\" the noninformative words in the query. In order to decouple these two distinct roles of smoothing, we propose a two-stage smoothing strategy, which yields better sensitivity patterns and facilitates the setting of smoothing parameters automatically. We further propose methods for estimating the smoothing parameters automatically. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.', 'venue': 'TOIS', 'year': 2004, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143869012', 'name': 'Chengxiang Zhai'}, {'authorId': '1739581', 'name': 'J.

This paper develops a nonconvex formulation of the phase retrieval problem as well as a concrete solution algorithm. In a nutshell, this algorithm starts with a careful initialization obtained by means of a spectral method, and then refines this initial estimate by iteratively applying novel update rules, which have low computational complexity, much like in a gradient descent scheme. The main contribution is that this algorithm is shown to rigorously allow the exact retrieval of phase information from a nearly minimal number of random measurements. Indeed, the sequence of successive iterates provably converges to the solution at a geometric rate so that the proposed scheme is efficient both in terms of computational and data resources. In theory, a variation on this scheme leads to a near-linear time algorithm for a physically realizable model based on coded diffraction patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods with various experiments on image data.

Learning to rank is useful for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and data mining. Intensive studies have been conducted on the problem recently and significant progress has been made. This lecture gives an introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, existing approaches, theories, applications, and future work. The author begins by showing that various ranking problems in information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking) and ranking aggregation. In ranking creation, given a request, one wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features derived from the request and the offerings. In ranking aggregation, given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings. Ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank. It is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. The author gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation, feature creation, and major approaches. Many methods have been proposed for ranking creation. The methods can be categorized as the pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the loss functions they employ. They can also be categorized according to the techniques they employ, such as the SVM based, Boosting SVM, Neural Network based approaches. The author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in details. These include PRank, OC SVM, Ranking SVM, IR SVM, GBRank, RankNet, LambdaRank, ListNet & ListMLE, AdaRank, SVM MAP, SoftRank, Borda Count, Markov Chain, and CRanking. The author explains several example applications of learning to rank including web search, collaborative filtering, definition search, keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in machine translation. A formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the statistical learning framework. Ongoing and future research directions for learning to rank are also discussed.

Keyword-based retrieval may return inaccurate and incomplete results when different keywords are used to describe the same concept in the documents and in the queries. Furthermore, the relationship between these related keywords may be semantic rather than syntactic, and capturing it thus requires access to comprehensive human world knowledge. Concept-based retrieval methods have attempted to tackle these difficulties by using manually built thesauri, by relying on term cooccurrence data, or by extracting latent word relationships and concepts from a corpus. In this article we introduce a new concept-based retrieval approach based on Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a recently proposed method that augments keyword-based text representation with concept-based features, automatically extracted from massive human knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia. Our approach generates new text features automatically, and we have found that high-quality feature selection becomes crucial in this setting to make the retrieval more focused. However, due to the lack of labeled data, traditional feature selection methods cannot be used, hence we propose new methods that use self-generated labeled training data. The resulting system is evaluated on several TREC datasets, showing superior performance over previous state-of-the-art results.', 'venue': 'TOIS', 'year': 2011, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1875787', 'name': 'Ofer Egozi'}, {'authorId': '2309269', 'name': 'Shaul Markovitch'}, {'authorId': '1718798', 'name': 'E.

Geographical place name ontologies, such as gazetteers and geographical thesauri, can help automate geographical information retrieval tasks that employ place names. Most gazetteer resources encoding knowledge of place names are based on official boundaries and provide no data for the many vague places that have no precise boundary but which are commonly used to communicate geographical information. Web search methods are used here to retrieve documents that contain both a target vague place name and the names of associated places, many of which are inside the target place and provide evidence for its spatial extent. Geoparsing and geocoding methods are employed to recognize the presence of the place names and to ground them with coordinates. Given a set of candidate point-referenced places associated with an imprecise place, two approaches are described to model the extent of the imprecise place. In the first approach techniques based on α-shapes and on Delaunay triangulation are employed to initialise and refine the boundary of the main cluster of candidate points. In the second method the frequencies of occurrence of the associated names are used to generate a density surface model that maps the extent of the target place with varying degrees of confidence. Thresholding the surface at particular density levels enables the creation of a set of possible boundaries. The methods are evaluated by approximating the boundaries of precise places before applying them to delineate imprecise places for which some expert knowledge is available.

In the task, a model is automatically created with some training data and then is utilized for ranking of documents. The goodness of a model is usually evaluated with performance measures such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). Ideally a learning algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data. Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures. For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking models by minimizing classification errors on instance pairs. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures. Our algorithm, referred to as AdaRank, repeatedly constructs 'weak rankers' on the basis of reweighted training data and finally linearly combines the weak rankers for making ranking predictions. We prove that the training process of AdaRank is exactly that of enhancing the performance measure used. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that AdaRank significantly outperforms the baseline methods of BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost.\", 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2007, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2150635498', 'name': 'Jun Xu'}, {'authorId': '49404233', 'name': 'Hang Li'}]}\n",

Various measures for spatial applications have been de- veloped, but a solid foundation for answering what they measure; how they are best ap- plied in information retrieval; which role contextual information plays; and how similarity values or rankings should be interpreted is still missing. It is therefore difficult to decide which measure should be used for a particular application or to compare results from dif- ferent similarity theories.

Our methodology is motivated by the empirical observation that good retrieval performance is closely related to the use of various retrieval heuristics. We connect the weaknesses and strengths of a retrieval function with its implementations of these retrieval heuristics, and propose two strategies to check how well a retrieval function implements the desired retrieval heuristics. The first strategy is to formalize heuristics as constraints, and use constraint analysis to analytically check the implementation of retrieval heuristics. The second strategy is to define a set of relevance-preserving perturbations and perform diagnostic tests to empirically evaluate how well a retrieval function implements retrieval heuristics. Experiments show that both strategies are effective to identify the potential problems in implementations of the retrieval heuristics. The performance of retrieval functions can be improved after we fix these problems.', 'venue': 'TOIS', 'year': 2011, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145344526', 'name': 'H.

Essentially, the search process can be viewed as a combination of inputs (queries and assessments) which are used to \"produce\" output (relevance). Under this view, it is possible to adapt microeconomic theory to analyze and understand the dynamics of Interactive Information Retrieval. In this paper, we approach the search process as an economics problem and conduct extensive simulations on TREC test collections analyzing various combinations of inputs in the \"production\" of relevance. The analysis reveals that the total Cumulative Gain (output) obtained during the course of a search session is functionally related to querying and assessing (inputs), and this can be characterized mathematically by the Cobbs-Douglas production function. Further analysis using cost models, that are grounded using cognitive load as the cost, reveals which search strategies minimize the cost of interaction for a given level of output. This paper demonstrates how economics can be applied to formally model the search process. This development establishes the theoretical foundations of Interactive Information Retrieval, providing numerous directions for empirical experimentation that are motivated directly from theory.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2011, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1716332', 'name': 'L.

The retrieval community has been extremely fortunate to have such a well-grounded evaluation paradigm during a period when most of the human language technologies were just developing. This lecture has the goal of explaining where these evaluation methodologies came from and how they have continued to adapt to the vastly changed environment in the search engine world today. The lecture starts with a discussion of the early evaluation of information retrieval systems, starting with the Cranfield testing in the early 1960s, continuing with the Lancaster \"user\" study for MEDLARS, and presenting the various test collection investigations by the SMART project and by groups in Britain. The emphasis in this chapter is on the how and the why of the various methodologies developed. The second chapter covers the more recent \"batch\" evaluations, examining the methodologies used in the various open evaluation campaigns such as TREC, NTCIR (emphasis on Asian languages), CLEF (emphasis on European languages), INEX (emphasis on semi-structured data), etc. Here again the focus is on the how and why, and in particular on the evolving of the older evaluation methodologies to handle new information access techniques. This includes how the test collection techniques were modified and how the metrics were changed to better reflect operational environments. The final chapters look at evaluation issues in user studies -- the interactive part of information retrieval, including a look at the search log studies mainly done by the commercial search engines. Here the goal is to show, via case studies, how the high-level issues of experimental design affect the final evaluations.

Natural language object retrieval differs from text-based image retrieval task as it involves spatial information about objects within the scene and global scene context. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatial Context Recurrent ConvNet (SCRC) model as scoring function on candidate boxes for object retrieval, integrating spatial configurations and global scene-level contextual information into the network. Our model processes query text, local image descriptors, spatial configurations and global context features through a recurrent network, outputs the probability of the query text conditioned on each candidate box as a score for the box, and can transfer visual-linguistic knowledge from image captioning domain to our task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes both local and global information, outperforming previous baseline methods significantly on different datasets and scenarios, and can exploit large scale vision and language datasets for knowledge transfer.', 'venue': 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition', 'year': 2015, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2874347', 'name': 'Ronghang Hu'}, {'authorId': '3286703', 'name': 'Huazhe Xu'}, {'authorId': '34849128', 'name': 'Marcus Rohrbach'}, {'authorId': '33221685', 'name': 'Jiashi Feng'}, {'authorId': '2903226', 'name': 'Kate Saenko'}, {'authorId': '1753210', 'name': 'Trevor Darrell'}]}\n",

It has been difficult to assess the quality of visualizations since the task has not been well-defined. We give a rigorous definition for a specific visualization task, resulting in quantifiable goodness measures and new visualization methods. The task is information retrieval given the visualization: to find similar data based on the similarities shown on the display. The fundamental tradeoff between precision and recall of information retrieval can then be quantified in visualizations as well. The user needs to give the relative cost of missing similar points vs. retrieving dissimilar points, after which the total cost can be measured. We then introduce a new method NeRV (neighbor retrieval visualizer) which produces an optimal visualization by minimizing the cost. We further derive a variant for supervised visualization; class information is taken rigorously into account when computing the similarity relationships.

Even for systems that succeed very well on average, the quality of results returned for some of the queries is poor. Thus, it is desirable that IR systems will be able to identify \"difficult\" queries in order to handle them properly. Understanding why some queries are inherently more difficult than others is essential for IR, and a good answer to this important question will help search engines to reduce the variance in performance, hence better servicing their customer needs. The high variability in query performance has driven a new research direction in the IR field on estimating the expected quality of the search results, i.e. the query difficulty, when no relevance feedback is given. Estimating the query difficulty is a significant challenge due to the numerous factors that impact retrieval performance. Many prediction methods have been proposed recently. However, as many researchers observed, the prediction quality of state-of-the-art predictors is still too low to be widely used by IR applications. The low prediction quality is due to the complexity of the task, which involves factors such as query ambiguity, missing content, and vocabulary mismatch. The goal of this tutorial is to expose participants to the current research on query performance prediction (also known as query difficulty estimation). Participants will become familiar with states-of-the-art performance prediction methods, and with common evaluation methodologies for prediction quality. We will discuss the reasons that cause search engines to fail for some of the queries, and provide an overview of several approaches for estimating query difficulty. We then describe common methodologies for evaluating the prediction quality of those estimators, and some experiments conducted recently with their prediction quality, as measured over several TREC benchmarks. We will cover a few potential applications that can utilize query difficulty estimators by handling each query individually and selectively based on its estimated difficulty. Finally we will summarize with a discussion on open issues and challenges in the field.', 'venue': 'Estimating the Query Difficulty for Information Retrieval', 'year': 2010, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1751914', 'name': 'David Carmel'}, {'authorId': '1388775854', 'name': 'E.

The problem of how to e ciently find information is older than computers, however. In libraries, systems using index cards have been used to catalogue all items in the library. An index card would contain a number of properties for a specific item, such as author, title, publisher, year, classification in some classification scheme and information on how the item could be retrieved (i.e. on what shelf it was placed).164 A complete index system for a library would have two or more sets of cards, sorted on di↵erent properties, i.e. one sorted by author’s surname and another sorted by the classification scheme. These systems support the most rudimentary forms of information retrieval. Particularly, it makes it possible to retrieve an item that is already known to exist, if some identifying property (or combination of properties) of it is known. If you know the author and title, you can look up the author in the set of cards that are sorted by author, and then look through each card until the correct title is found, and on that card read on which shelf the item is stored. At first, computer systems did not have storage enough to store the full text of documents. Furthermore, the process of digitizing existing documents required that the text be keyed in by hand.

Many scores have been proposed for this purpose over the years. These have primarily focused on aspects of precision and recall, and while these are often discussed with equal importance, in practice most attention has been given to precision focused metrics. Even for recall-oriented IR tasks of growing importance, such as patent retrieval, these precision based scores remain the primary evaluation measures. Our study examines different evaluation measures for a recall-oriented patent retrieval task and demonstrates the limitations of the current scores in comparing different IR systems for this task. We introduce PRES, a novel evaluation metric for this type of application taking account of recall and the user's search effort. The behaviour of PRES is demonstrated on 48 runs from the CLEF-IP 2009 patent retrieval track. A full analysis of the performance of PRES shows its suitability for measuring the retrieval effectiveness of systems from a recall focused perspective taking into account the user's expected search effort.\", 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2010, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1745226', 'name': 'Walid Magdy'}, {'authorId': '143723939', 'name': 'G.

A main challenge in applying translation models to ad hoc information retrieval is to estimate a translation model without training data. Existing work has relied on training on synthetic queries generated based on a document collection. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not have a good coverage of query words. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to estimate a translation model based on normalized mutual information between words, which is less computationally expensive and has better coverage of query words than the synthetic query method of estimation. We also propose to regularize estimated translation probabilities to ensure sufficient probability mass for self-translation. Experiment results show that the proposed mutual information-based estimation method is not only more efficient, but also more effective than the synthetic query-based method, and it can be combined with pseudo-relevance feedback to further improve retrieval accuracy. The results also show that the proposed regularization strategy is effective and can improve retrieval accuracy for both synthetic query-based estimation and mutual information-based estimation.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2010, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2236832', 'name': 'Maryam Karimzadehgan'}, {'authorId': '1736467', 'name': 'ChengXiang Zhai'}]}\n",

Particularly promising are experiments that interleave two rankings and track user clicks. According to a recent study, interleaving experiments can identify large differences in retrieval effectiveness with much better reliability than other click-based methods. We study interleaving in more detail, comparing it with traditional measures in terms of reliability, sensitivity and agreement. To detect very small differences in retrieval effectiveness, a reliable outcome with standard metrics requires about 5,000 judged queries, and this is about as reliable as interleaving with 50,000 user impressions.

As in quantum theory, a probability distribution over these subspaces is defined through weighted sets of state vectors (density operators), and used to represent the current view of the retrieval system on the user information need. Tensor spaces can be used to capture different aspects of information needs. Our evaluation shows that the framework can lead to acceptable performance in an ad-hoc retrieval task.

More than four decades after it was first proposed, the seminal error reduction algorithm of Gerchberg and Saxton and Fienup is still the popular choice for solving many variants of this problem. The algorithm is based on alternating minimization; i.e., it alternates between estimating the missing phase information, and the candidate solution. Despite its wide usage in practice, no global convergence guarantees for this algorithm are known. In this paper, we show that a (resampling) variant of this approach converges geometrically to the solution of one such problem-finding a vector x from y, A, where y = |ATx| and |z| denotes a vector of element-wise magnitudes of z-under the assumption that A is Gaussian. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternating minimization performs similar to recently proposed convex techniques for this problem (which are based on “lifting” to a convex matrix problem) in sample complexity and robustness to noise. However, it is much more efficient and can scale to large problems. Analytically, for a resampling version of alternating minimization, we show geometric convergence to the solution, and sample complexity that is off by log factors from obvious lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling for the case when the unknown vector is sparse.

We define two types of term frequency normalization for tuning term weights in the document--query matching process. The first normalization assumes that documents have the same length and measures the information gain with the observed term once it has been accepted as a good descriptor of the observed document. The second normalization is related to the document length and to other statistics. These two normalization methods are applied to the basic models in succession to obtain weighting formulae.

One advantage of this new approach is its statistical foundations.

Such expansion-based feedback creates an inconsistent interpretation of the original and the expanded query. In this paper, we present a more principled approach to feedback in the language modeling approach. Specifically, we treat feedback as updating the query language model based on the extra evidence carried by the feedback documents. Such a model-based feedback strategy easily fits into an extension of the language modeling approach. We propose and evaluate two different approaches to updating a query language model based on feedback documents, one based on a generative probabilistic model of feedback documents and one based on minimization of the KL-divergence over feedback documents.

The intriguing bit here is that the query itself can be a multimedia excerpt: For example, when you walk around in an unknown place and stumble across an interesting landmark, would it not be great if you could just take a picture with your mobile phone and send it to a service that finds a similar picture in a database and tells you more about the building - and about its significance for that matter? The ideas for this type of search have been around for a decade, but this tutorial will look at recent successes and take stock of the state-of-the-art. It examines the full matrix of a variety of query modes versus document types. How do you retrieve a music piece by humming? What if you want to find news video clips on forest fires using a still image? The tutorial discusses underlying techniques and common approaches to facilitate multimedia search engines: metadata driven search; piggy-back text search where automated processes create text surrogates for multimedia; automated image annotation; content-based search. The latter is studied in more depth looking at features and distances, and how to effectively combine them for efficient retrieval, to a point where the participants have the ingredients and recipe in their hands for building their own visual search engines.

Background and Theory', 'abstract': \"We report the results of a British Library Research and Development Department‐funded design study for an interactive information retrieval system which will determine structural representations of the anomalous states of knowledge (ASKs) underlying information needs, and attempt to resolve the anomalies through a variety of retrieval strategies performed on a database of documents represented in compatible structural formats. Part I discusses the background to the project and the theory underlying it, Part II (next issue) presents our methods, results and conclusions. Basic premises of the project were: that information needs are not in principle precisely specifiable; that it is possible to elicit problem statements from information system users from which representations of the ASK underlying the need can be derived; that there are classes of ASKs; and, that all elements of information retrieval systems ought to be based on the user's ASK. We have developed a relatively freeform interview technique for eliciting problem statements, and a statistical word co‐occurrence analysis for deriving network representations of the problem statements and abstracts. Structural characteristics of the representations have been used to determine classes of ASKs, and both ASK and information structures have been evaluated by, respectively, users and authors. Some results are: that interviewing appears to be a satisfactory technique for eliciting problem statements from which ASKs can be determined; that the statistical analysis produces structures which are generally appropriate both for documents and problem statements; that ASKs thus represented can be usefully classified according to their structural characteristics; and, that of thirty‐five subjects, only two had ASKs for which traditional ‘best match’ retrieval would be intuitively appropriate. The results of the design study indicate that at least some of our premises are reasonable, and that an ASK‐based information retrieval system is at least feasible.\", 'venue': 'J.

Existing studies have only attempted to use a standard language model as a \"black box\" to implement these heuristics, making it hard to optimize the combination parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel positional language model (PLM) which implements both heuristics in a unified language model. The key idea is to define a language model for each position of a document, and score a document based on the scores of its PLMs. The PLM is estimated based on propagated counts of words within a document through a proximity-based density function, which both captures proximity heuristics and achieves an effect of \"soft\" passage retrieval. We propose and study several representative density functions and several different PLM-based document ranking strategies.

In the vector processing model of retrieval, the retrieved items are easily ranked in decreasing order of the query-record similarity, but the queries themselves are unstructured and expressed as simple sets of weighted index terms. A new, extended Boolean information retrieval system is introduced which is intermediate between the Boolean system of query processing and the vector processing model. The query structure inherent in the Boolean system is preserved, while at the same time weighted terms may be incorporated into both queries and stored documents; the retrieved output can also be ranked in strict similarity order with the user queries. A conventional retrieval system can be modified to make use of the extended system.

The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. We argue that much of the reason for this is the lack of an adequate indexing model. This suggests that perhaps a better indexing model would help solve the problem. However, we feel that making unwarranted parametric assumptions will not lead to better retrieval performance. Furthermore, making prior assumptions about the similarity of documents is not warranted either. Instead, we propose an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling. We estimate models for each document individually. Our approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates document indexing and document retrieval into a single model. One advantage of our approach is that collection statistics which are used heuristically in many other retrieval models are an integral part of our model.

For each of these five tests, we took the ad-hoc retrieval runs submitted to TRECs 3 and 5-8, and for each pair of runs, we measured the statistical significance of the difference in their mean average precision. We discovered that there is little practical difference between the randomization, bootstrap, and t tests.

MIR consists in quick and efficient searching for various types of audio data of interest to the user, and filtering them in order to receive only the data items which satisfy the user’s preferences (Fingerhut, 1997), (International Organization for Standardization, 2003), (Wieczorkowska & Ras, 2003).

The MIR topics are interrelated, since similar techniques can be applied for various purposes, e.g., source separation is applied in auditory scene analysis, music transcription, and even for restoring (de-noising) of all recordings. Generally, the research within MIR domain is focused on: harmonic structure analysis, note extraction, melody and rhythm tracking, timbre and instrument recognition, classification of type of the signal (speech, music, pitched vs. non-pitched), etc. The research basically uses digital audio recordings, where sound waveform is digitally stored as a sequence of discrete samples representing the sound intensity at given time instant, and MIDI files, storing information on parameters of electronically synthesized sounds (voice, note on, note off, pitch bend etc.).

Inspired by the Modern Portfolio Theory, an economic theory dealing with investment in financial markets, we argue that ranking under uncertainty is not just about picking individual relevant documents, but about choosing the right combination of relevant documents. This motivates us to quantify a ranked list of documents on the basis of its expected overall relevance (mean) and its variance; the latter serves as a measure of risk, which was rarely studied for document ranking in the past. Through the analysis of the mean and variance, we show that an optimal rank order is the one that balancing the overall relevance (mean) of the ranked list against its risk level (variance). Based on this principle, we then derive an efficient document ranking algorithm. It generalizes the well-known probability ranking principle (PRP) by considering both the uncertainty of relevance predictions and correlations between retrieved documents. Moreover, the benefit of diversification is mathematically quantified; we show that diversifying documents is an effective way to reduce the risk of document ranking.

In this paper, we present a learning approach to adaptively predict the optimal balance coefficient for each query and each collection. We propose three heuristics to characterize the balance between query and feedback information. Taking these three heuristics as a road map, we explore a number of features and combine them using a regression approach to predict the balance coefficient. Our experiments show that the proposed adaptive relevance feedback is more robust and effective than the regular fixed-coefficient feedback.', 'venue': 'International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management', 'year': 2009, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40282698', 'name': 'Yuanhua Lv'}, {'authorId': '1736467', 'name': 'ChengXiang Zhai'}]}\n",

Spectral-based approaches to MIR tasks have led to advancements in the MIR field but they now appear to be reaching their limits of effectiveness. This limitation is called the “glass ceiling” problem and the MIREX results data support its existence. The post-hoc analyses of MIREX results data indicate that there are groups of systems that perform equally well within various MIR tasks. There are many challenges facing MIREX and MIR research most of which have their root causes in the intellectual property issues surrounding music.

The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability. The resulting technique called “Probabilistic Indexing,” allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the “relevance number”) for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request. The result of a search is an ordered list of those documents which satisfy the request ranked according to their probable relevance.\\nThe paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (“see” and “see also”) is based solely on the “semantical closeness” between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.\\nFinally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user.', 'venue': 'JACM', 'year': 1960, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144864352', 'name': 'M.

Specifically, these efforts have relatively ignored two distinct characteristics of CBIR systems: (1) the gap between high-level concepts and low-level features, and (2) the subjectivity of human perception of visual content. This paper proposes a relevance feedback based interactive retrieval approach, which effectively takes into account the above two characteristics in CBIR. During the retrieval process, the user's high-level query and perception subjectivity are captured by dynamically updated weights based on the user's feedback. The experimental results over more than 70000 images show that the proposed approach greatly reduces the user's effort of composing a query, and captures the user's information need more precisely.\", 'venue': 'IEEE Trans.

Set in a cognitive framework, the paper outlines the concept of polyrepresentation applied to both the user's cognitive space and the information space of IR systems. The concept seeks to represent the current user's information need, problem state, and domain work task or interest in a structure of causality. Further, it implies that we should apply different methods of representation and a variety of IR techniques of different cognitive and functional origin simultaneously to each semantic full‐text entity in the information space. The cognitive differences imply that by applying cognitive overlaps of information objects, originating from different interpretations of such objects through time and by type, the degree of uncertainty inherent in IR is decreased. Polyrepresentation and the use of cognitive overlaps are associated with, but not identical to, data fusion in IR. By explicitly incorporating all the cognitive structures participating in the interactive communication processes during IR, the cognitive theory provides a comprehensive view of these processes. It encompasses the ad hoc theories of text retrieval and IR techniques hitherto developed in mainstream retrieval research. It has elements in common with van Rijsbergen and Lalmas' logical uncertainty theory and may be regarded as compatible with that conception of IR. Epistemologically speaking, the theory views IR interaction as processes of cognition, potentially occurring in all the information processing components of IR, that may be applied, in particular, to the user in a situational context. The theory draws upon basic empirical results from information seeking investigations in the operational online environment, and from mainstream IR research on partial matching techniques and relevance feedback. By viewing users, source systems, intermediary mechanisms and information in a global context, the cognitive perspective attempts a comprehensive understanding of essential IR phenomena and concepts, such as the nature of information needs, cognitive inconsistency and retrieval overlaps, logical uncertainty, the concept of ‘document’, relevance measures and experimental settings. An inescapable consequence of this approach is to rely more on sociological and psychological investigative methods when evaluating systems and to view relevance in IR as situational, relative, partial, differentiated and non‐linear. The lack of consistency among authors, indexers, evaluators or users is of an identical cognitive nature. It is unavoidable, and indeed favourable to IR. In particular, for full‐text retrieval, alternative semantic entities, including Salton et al.'s ‘passage retrieval’, are proposed to replace the traditional document record as the basic retrieval entity. These empirically observed phenomena of inconsistency and of semantic entities and values associated with data interpretation support strongly a cognitive approach to IR and the logical use of polyrepresentation, cognitive overlaps, and both data fusion and data diffusion.\", 'venue': 'J.

This suggests that there still remain substantial challenges for research in IR. Already in 1988, on the occasion of receiving the ACM SIGIR Gerard Salton Award, Karen Spärck Jones suggested that substantial progress in information retrieval was likely only to come through addressing issues associated with users (actual or potential) of IR systems, rather than continuing IR research's almost exclusive focus on document representation and matching and ranking techniques. In recent years it appears that her message has begun to be heard, yet we still have relatively few substantive results that respond to it. In this paper, I identify and discuss a few challenges for IR research which fall within the scope of association with users, and which I believe, if properly addressed, are likely to lead to substantial increases in the usefulness, usability and pleasurability of information retrieval.\", 'venue': 'SIGF', 'year': 2008, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2095083', 'name': 'N.

The ability to extract useful information from large electronic resources not only is one of the main activities of individuals online but is an essential skill for most professional groups and a means of achieving competitive advantage. Our electronic information world is becoming increasingly complex with more sources of information, types of information, and ways to access information than ever before. Anyone who searches for information is required to make more decisions about searching and expected to engage with an increased number and variety of search systems. Even a standard desktop personal computer comes equipped with numerous search tools (desktop search, e-mail search, browsers to help search the Internet, embedded search tools for specific file formats such as PDF [portable document format] or Word, and specific document types such as help manuals). A standard day, if one is electronically enabled, may involve many searches across different search systems accessing different electronic resources for different purposes. The Internet, in particular, has revolutionized the ability to search, especially in the commercial arena where we have the choice of using different search systems to search essentially the same electronic resources but with different interactive functionalities. The search decisions a human is required to make before encountering any information involve not only how to search this resource using this system but also how to choose a system or resource to search in the first place. These decisions are complicated because skills learned using one type of system do not always transfer simply to searching a different type of system (Cool, Park, Belkin, Koenemann, & Ng, 1996). Neither does information literacy in one domain of expertise necessarily help when searching on unfamiliar topics. The variability of data available, and the explicit or implicit structures of the data, also place a burden on both the searchers and system designers. How does searching within a Weblog, for example, differ from searching within technical manuals; or does all searching involve the same activities and require the same user support?

We provide a fundamentally different interpretation, that it is not retrieval of semantic knowledge per se that is associated with left IFG activity but rather selection of information among competing alternatives from semantic memory. Selection demands were varied across three semantic tasks in a single group of subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in overlapping regions of left IFG was dependent on selection demands in all three tasks. In addition, the degree of semantic processing was varied independently of selection demands in one of the tasks. The absence of left IFG activity for this comparison counters the argument that the effects of selection can be attributed solely to variations in degree of semantic retrieval. Our findings suggest that it is selection, not retrieval, of semantic knowledge that drives activity in the left IFG.', 'venue': 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America', 'year': 1997, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1398907287', 'name': 'S.

How do we know which of these techniques are effective in which applications? Should we use stop lists? Should we stem? Should we use inverse document frequency weighting? IR has developed as a highly empirical discipline, requiring careful and thorough evaluation to demonstrate the superior performance of novel techniques on representative document collections. In this chapter, we begin with a discussion of measuring the effectiveness of IR systems (Section 8.1) and the test collections that are most often used for this purpose (Section 8.2). We then present the straightforward notion of relevant and nonrelevant documents and the formal evaluation methodology that has been developed for evaluating unranked retrieval results (Section 8.3). This includes explaining the kinds of evaluation measures that are standardly used for document retrieval and related tasks like text classification and why they are appropriate. We then extend these notions and develop further measures for evaluating ranked retrieval results (Section 8.4) and discuss developing reliable and informative test collections (Section 8.5). We then step back to introduce the notion of user utility, and how it is approximated by the use of document relevance (Section 8.6). The key utility measure is user happiness.

In essence, ESA represents documents as vectors in the space of Wikipedia articles, using the tfidf measure to capture how “important” a Wikipedia article is for a specific word. The interesting property of ESA is that arbitrary documents can be represented as a vector with respect to the Wikipedia article space. ESA thus replaces the standard BOW model for retrieval. In our cross-lingual extension of ESA, the cross-language links of Wikipedia are used in order to map the ESA vectors between different languages, thus allowing retrieval across languages.

In these situations (e.g., extinction, counterconditioning, and latent inhibition), a conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated with different unconditioned stimuli (USs) or outcomes in different phases of the experiment; retroactive interference, proactive interference, or both are often observed. In all of the paradigms, contextual stimuli influence performance, and when information is available, so does the passage of time. Memories of both phases are retained, and performance may depend on which is retrieved. Despite the similarity of the paradigms, conditioning theories tend to explain them with separate mechanisms. They also do not provide an adequate account of the context\\'s role, fail to predict the effects of time, and overemphasize the role of learning or storage deficits. By accepting 4 propositions about animal memory (i.e., contextual stimuli guide retrieval, time is a context, different memories are differentially dependent on context, and interference occurs at performance output), a memory retrieval framework can provide an integrated account of context, time, and performance in the various paradigms.', 'venue': 'Psychological bulletin', 'year': 1993, 'authors': [{'authorId': '4680033', 'name': 'M.

Textpresso's two major elements are a collection of the full text of scientific articles split into individual sentences, and the implementation of categories of terms for which a database of articles and individual sentences can be searched. The categories are classes of biological concepts (e.g., gene, allele, cell or cell group, phenotype, etc.) and classes that relate two objects (e.g., association, regulation, etc.) or describe one (e.g., biological process, etc.). Together they form a catalog of types of objects and concepts called an ontology. After this ontology is populated with terms, the whole corpus of articles and abstracts is marked up to identify terms of these categories. The current ontology comprises 33 categories of terms. A search engine enables the user to search for one or a combination of these tags and/or keywords within a sentence or document, and as the ontology allows word meaning to be queried, it is possible to formulate semantic queries. Full text access increases recall of biological data types from 45% to 95%. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences; in searches for two uniquely named genes and an interaction term, the ontology confers a 3-fold increase of search efficiency. Textpresso currently focuses on Caenorhabditis elegans literature, with 3,800 full text articles and 16,000 abstracts. The lexicon of the ontology contains 14,500 entries, each of which includes all versions of a specific word or phrase, and it includes all categories of the Gene Ontology database. Textpresso is a useful curation tool, as well as search engine for researchers, and can readily be extended to other organism-specific corpora of text.

Many variants of the basic PIR model have been proposed, including such modifications as computational vs. information-theoretic privacy protection, correctness in the face of servers that fail to respond or that respond incorrectly, and protection of sensitive data against the database servers themselves. In this paper, we improve on the robustness of PIR in a number of ways. First, we present a Byzantine-robust PIR protocol which provides information-theoretic privacy protection against coalitions of up to all but one of the responding servers, improving the previous result by a factor of 3. In addition, our protocol allows for more of the responding servers to return incorrect information while still enabling the user to compute the correct result. We then extend our protocol so that queries have information-theoretic protection if a limited number of servers collude, as before, but still retain computational protection if they all collude. We also extend the protocol to provide information-theoretic protection to the contents of the database against collusions of limited numbers of the database servers, at no additional communication cost or increase in the number of servers. All of our protocols retrieve a block of data with communication cost only O(lscr) times the size of the block, where lscr is the number of servers. Finally, we discuss our implementation of these protocols, and measure their performance in order to determine their practicality.', 'venue': 'IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy', 'year': 2007, 'authors': [{'authorId': '34614659', 'name': 'I.

Such a proximity heuristic, however, has been largely under-explored in the literature; it is unclear how we can model proximity and incorporate a proximity measure into an existing retrieval model. In this paper,we systematically explore the query term proximity heuristic. Specifically, we propose and study the effectiveness of five different proximity measures, each modeling proximity from a different perspective. We then design two heuristic constraints and use them to guide us in incorporating the proposed proximity measures into an existing retrieval model. Experiments on five standard TREC test collections show that one of the proposed proximity measures is indeed highly correlated with document relevance, and by incorporating it into the KL-divergence language model and the Okapi BM25 model, we can significantly improve retrieval performance.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2007, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2056234035', 'name': 'Tao Tao'}, {'authorId': '1736467', 'name': 'ChengXiang Zhai'}]}\n",

Research on Arabic IR is still much less extensive than that on English-language IR, which has dominated the field for the past 50 years, despite the fact that Arabic is one of the five languages of the United Nations, the mother tongue of over 256 million people, and, because it is the language of the Qur’an, the second language of many Muslims and Muslim countries around the world (Brunner, 2005). The lack of research in Arabic IR is due in part to the fact that Arabic is a unique language with a structure that differs from Latin-based languages. Research in Latin languages or even Hebrew, which belongs to the same language group as Arabic, is not directly applicable to it because of the difficulties of dealing with its different characteristics and structure. Another important reason is the lack of funding and standard evaluation sources for practitioners in the field of Arabic IR. The quality of any IR system’s response to an information need stated in a query is usually referred to as effectiveness. The effectiveness of an IR system in a language other than English and the ability of this system to perform efficiently depend on the system’s capacity to conform to the specific language in use. This means that understanding the characteristics of the language in hand is of great importance. An IR system created, for instance, for the English language cannot be used for retrieval in another language before adjusting to that language. Such adjustment can be minimal, especially with languages written with the Roman alphabet. However, when dealing with a language written in a non-Roman script, such as Arabic, the adjustment can be significant. This chapter reviews research and applications in Arabic information retrieval, a research area that has become increasingly important in the past few years. The field of Arabic computational linguistics and applications has received considerable attention-in particular, Arabic IR.', 'venue': 'Annual Review of Information Science and Technology', 'year': 2007, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1403987068', 'name': 'I.

However, to improve the system–user interaction, it seems more adequate to express these linguistic weights and degrees by means of unbalanced linguistic scales, that is, linguistic term sets with different discrimination levels on both sides of the middle linguistic term. In this contribution we present an information retrieval system that accepts weighted queries whose weights are expressed using unbalanced linguistic term sets. Then, the system provides the retrieved documents classified in linguistic relevance classes assessed on unbalanced linguistic term sets. To do so, we propose a methodology to manage unbalanced linguistic information and we use the linguistic 2‐tuple model as the representation base of the unbalanced linguistic information. Additionally, the linguistic 2‐tuple model allows us to increase the number of relevance classes in the output and also to improve the performance of the information retrieval system. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, for a specific information need, only a small subset of all of the available information will be useful. The field of information retrieval (IR) is the study of methods to provide users with that small subset of information relevant to their needs and to do so in a timely fashion. Information sources can take many forms, but this thesis will focus on text based information systems and investigate problems germane to the retrieval of written natural language documents. \\n \\nCentral to these problems is the notion of \"topic.\" In other words, what are documents about? However, topics depend on the semantics of documents and retrieval systems are not endowed with knowledge of the semantics of natural language. The approach taken in this thesis will be to make use of probabilistic language models to investigate text based information retrieval and related problems. \\n \\nOne such problem is the prediction of topic shifts in text, the topic segmentation problem. It will be shown that probabilistic methods can be used to predict topic changes in the context of the task of new event detection. Two complementary sets of features are studied individually and then combined into a single language model. The language modeling approach allows this problem to be approached in a principled way without complex semantic modeling. \\n \\nNext, the problem of document retrieval in response to a user query will be investigated. Models of document indexing and document retrieval have been extensively studied over the past three decades. The integration of these two classes of models has been the goal of several researchers but it is a very difficult problem. Much of the reason for this is that the indexing component requires inferences as to the semantics of documents. Instead, an approach to retrieval based on probabilistic language modeling will be presented. Models are estimated for each document individually. The approach to modeling is non-parametric and integrates the entire retrieval process into a single model. One advantage of this approach is that collection statistics, which are used heuristically for the assignment of concept probabilities in other probabilistic models, are used directly in the estimation of language model probabilities in this approach. The language modeling approach has been implemented and tested empirically and performs very well on standard test collections and query sets. \\n \\nIn order to improve retrieval effectiveness, IR systems use additional techniques such as relevance feedback, unsupervised query expansion and structured queries. These and other techniques are discussed in terms of the language modeling approach and empirical results are given for several of the techniques developed. These results provide further proof of concept for the use of language models for retrieval tasks.', 'venue': 'SIGIR Forum', 'year': 1998, 'authors': [{'authorId': '40395378', 'name': 'J.

The search engines that perform the information retrieval tasks, often retrieve thousands of potentially interesting documents to a query.

This book describes a mathematical model of information retrieval based on the use of statistical language models. The approach uses simple document-based unigram models to compute for each document the probability that it generates the query. This probability is used to rank the documents. The study makes the following research contributions. \\n \\n * The development of a model that integrates term weighting, relevance feedback and structured queries. \\n * The development of a model that supports multiple representations of a request or information need by integrating a statistical translation model. \\n * The development of a model that supports multiple representations of a document, for instance by allowing proximity searches or searches for terms from a particular record field (e.g. a search for terms from the title). \\n * A mathematical interpretation of stop word removal and stemming. \\n * A mathematical interpretation of operators for mandatory terms, wildcards and synonyms. \\n * A practical comparison of a language model-based retrieval system with similar systems that are based on well-established models and term weighting algorithms in a controlled experiment. \\n * The application of the model to cross-language information retrieval and adaptive information filtering, and the evaluation of two prototype systems in a controlled experiment. \\n \\nExperimental results on three standard tasks show that the language model-based algorithms work as well as, or better than, today's top-performing retrieval algorithms. The standard tasks investigated are ad-hoc retrieval (when there are no previously retrieved documents to guide the search), retrospective relevance weighting (find the optimum model for a given set of relevant documents), and ad-hoc retrieval using manually formulated Boolean queries. The application to cross-language retrieval and adaptive filtering shows the practical use of respectively structured queries, and relevance feedback.\", 'venue': '', 'year': 2001, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1691929', 'name': 'D.

Voorhees and Donna K. Harman', 'abstract': 'TREC, the Text Retrieval Conference, is the information retrieval (IR) community’s annual evaluation forum, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The event is split into tracks (e.g., ad hoc retrieval, filtering, question answering) that encapsulate different research agendas in the community. The end result of each track meeting is an overview report written by the track organizers and a collection of technical reports by the track participants. Many of these reports, after some refinement, find their way into leading IR-related conferences such as SIGIR, and every few years a special issue dedicated to a particular TREC or a TREC track is published. The purpose of the present book is fourfold: to collate and distill 12 years’ worth of experiments (1991–2003) into a single volume; to provide some historical perspective on the evolution of the tasks; to share some of the general findings across tracks; and to encourage participants to take an introspective look at their progress and ask the question,What next for TREC? Despite TREC’s obvious focus on ad hoc retrieval (i.e., given a query return a ranked list of relevant documents), this book has a surprising amount to offer the natural language processing (NLP) community, particularly to researchers interested in question answering (QA) and text summarization, and to a lesser extent researchers concerned with the application of information extraction (IE), machine translation, speech processing, and language-generation technologies. It must be stressed, however, that this is not a book for readers looking for an introduction to IR concepts; there are many adequate textbooks that already fill this need such as that of Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto (1999). Instead it should be viewed as a starting point for researchers who are using standard IR techniques, such as passage retrieval or a term-weighting function, and would like to investigate the state of the art as determined by TREC’s evaluation results. In this review, I will make reference to these NLP interests where appropriate. The book consists of three parts: The first provides a three-chapter overview of TREC, structured around its different tracks, its evaluation methodology, and its test collections; the second consists of seven chapters on selected track reports; and the final part contains seven reports from the perspective of the participants, many of whom have devoted their efforts to multiple TREC tasks over the years. All of these contributions are of a high quality; this is not surprising given that most of the participants have been working on their respective areas for at least the duration of their TREC track(s). Each chapter is followed by its own bibliography, and a comprehensive 12-page index at the back of the book contains entries for keywords and referenced authors.

Typically, semantic similarity is computed by mapping terms to an ontology and by examining their relationships in that ontology. We investigate approaches to computing the semantic similarity between natural language terms (using WordNet as the underlying reference ontology) and between medical terms (using the MeSH ontology of medical and biomedical terms). The most popular semantic similarity methods are implemented and evaluated using WordNet and MeSH. Building upon semantic similarity, we propose the Semantic Similarity based Retrieval Model (SSRM), a novel information retrieval method capable for discovering similarities between documents containing conceptually similar terms. The most effective semantic similarity method is implemented into SSRM. SSRM has been applied in retrieval on OHSUMED (a standard TREC collection available on the Web).

Overall, the semantic combination techniques overcome a conceptual barrier rather than a technical one: these methods can be seen as a combination of late fusion and image reranking.

The search cost (in terms of different nodes searched and data transmitted) for a given query is thereby reduced, since the indices of semantically related documents are likely to be co located in the network.We also describe techniques that help distribute the indices more evenly across the nodes, and further reduce the number of nodes accessed using appropriate index distribution as well as using index samples and recently processed queries to guide the search.Experiments show that pSearch can achieve performance comparable to centralized information retrieval systems by searching only a small number of nodes.

The former specifies the environment of a query such as the domain of interest, while the latter refers to context words within the query, which is particularly useful for the selection of relevant term relations.

With the ultimate goal of building personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the problem of intelligent music information retrieval. Huron points out that since the preeminent functions of music are social and psychological, the most useful characterization would be based on four types of information: genre, emotion, style,and similarity. This paper introduces Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms (DWCH)for music feature extraction for music information retrieval. The histograms are computed from the coefficients of the db/sub 8/ Daubechies wavelet filter applied to 3 s of music. A comparative study of sound features and classification algorithms on a dataset compiled by Tzanetakis shows that combining DWCH with timbral features (MFCC and FFT), with the use of multiclass extensions of support vector machine,achieves approximately 80% of accuracy, which is a significant improvement over the previously known result on this dataset. On another dataset the combination achieves 75% of accuracy. The paper also studies the issue of detecting emotion in music. Rating of two subjects in the three bipolar adjective pairs are used. The accuracy of around 70% was achieved in predicting emotional labeling in these adjective pairs. The paper also studies the problem of identifying groups of artists based on their lyrics and sound using a semi-supervised classification algorithm. Identification of artist groups based on the Similar Artist lists at All Music Guide is attempted.

The main hypothesis is that the inclusion of conceptual knowledge such as ontologies in the information retrieval process can contribute to the solution of major problems currently found in information retrieval. This utilization of ontologies has a number of challenges. Our focus is on the use of similarity measures derived from the knowledge about relations between concepts in ontologies, the recognition of semantic information in texts and the mapping of this knowledge into the ontologies in use, as well as how to fuse together the ideas of ontological similarity and ontological indexing into a realistic information retrieval scenario. To achieve the recognition of semantic knowledge in a text, shallow natural language processing is used during indexing that reveals knowledge to the level of noun phrases. Furthermore, we briefly cover the identification of semantic relations inside and between noun phrases, as well as discuss which kind of problems are caused by an increase in compoundness with respect to the structure of concepts in the evaluation of queries. Measuring similarity between concepts based on distances in the structure of the ontology is discussed. In addition, a shared nodes measure is introduced and, based on a set of intuitive similarity properties, compared to a number of different measures. In this comparison the shared nodes measure appears to be superior, though more computationally complex. Some of the major problems of shared nodes which relate to the way relations differ with respect to the degree they bring the concepts they connect closer are discussed. A generalized measure called weighted shared nodes is introduced to deal with these problems. Finally, the utilization of concept similarity in query evaluation is discussed. A semantic expansion approach that incorporates concept similarity is introduced and a generalized fuzzy set retrieval model that applies expansion during query evaluation is presented. While not commonly used in present information retrieval systems, it appears that the fuzzy set model comprises the flexibility needed when generalizing to an ontology-based retrieval model and, with the introduction of a hierarchical fuzzy aggregation principle, compound concepts can be handled in a straightforward and natural manner.', 'venue': '', 'year': 2006, 'authors': [{'authorId': '69417231', 'name': 'Henrik Bulskov Styltsvig'}]}\n",

The main cost measure for such a scheme is its communication complexity. In this paper we introduce a model of symmetrically-private information retrieval (SPIR), where the privacy of the data, as well as the privacy of the user, is guaranteed. That is, in every invocation of a SPIR protocol, the user learns only a single physical bit of x and no other information about the data. Previously known PIR schemes severely fail to meet this goal. We show how to transform PIR schemes into SPIR schemes (with information-theoretic privacy), paying a constant factor in communication complexity. To this end, we introduce and utilize a new cryptographic primitive, called conditional disclosure of secrets, which we believe may be a useful building block for the design of other cryptographic protocols.

We find that the t-test is highly reliable (more so than the sign or Wilcoxon test), and is far more reliable than simply showing a large percentage difference in effectiveness measures between IR systems. Our results show that past empirical work on significance tests over-estimated the error of such tests.

In this paper, we show that semantic term matching can be naturally incorporated into the axiomatic retrieval model through defining the primitive weighting function based on a semantic similarity function of terms. We define several desirable retrieval constraints for semantic term matching and use such constraints to extend the axiomatic model to directly support semantic term matching based on the mutual information of terms computed on some document set. We show that such extension can be efficiently implemented as query expansion. Experiment results on several representative data sets show that, with mutual information computed over the documents in either the target collection for retrieval or an external collection such as the Web, our semantic expansion consistently and substantially improves retrieval accuracy over the baseline axiomatic retrieval model.

For some years now, I have felt the need to describe such a framework. It is especially important if one wants to develop information retrieval beyond the mere keyword approach. In the closing pages of my earlier book on the subject I said the following: “It has never been assumed that a retrieval system should attempt to understand” the content of a document. Most Information Retrieval systems at the moment merely aim at a bibliographic search. Documents are deemed to be relevant on the basis of a superficial description. I do not suggest that it is going to be a simple matter to program a computer to understand documents. What is suggested is that some attempt should be made to construct something like a naive model, using more than just keywords, of the content of each document in the system. The more sophisticated question-answering systems do something very similar.

One basic research question is thus what exactly are these \"necessary\" heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval performance. In this paper, we present a formal study of retrieval heuristics. We formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval function should satisfy, and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions. We find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally. Empirical results show that when a constraint is not satisfied, it often indicates non-optimality of the method, and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter values, its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range. In general, we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints.

One basic research question is thus what exactly are these \"necessary\" heuristics that seem to cause good retrieval performance. In this paper, we present a formal study of retrieval heuristics. We formally define a set of basic desirable constraints that any reasonable retrieval function should satisfy, and check these constraints on a variety of representative retrieval functions. We find that none of these retrieval functions satisfies all the constraints unconditionally. Empirical results show that when a constraint is not satisfied, it often indicates non-optimality of the method, and when a constraint is satisfied only for a certain range of parameter values, its performance tends to be poor when the parameter is out of the range. In general, we find that the empirical performance of a retrieval formula is tightly related to how well it satisfies these constraints. Thus the proposed constraints provide a good explanation of many empirical observations and make it possible to evaluate any existing or new retrieval formula analytically.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2004, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145344526', 'name': 'H.

However, most of the existing LM approaches only rely on term occurrences in documents, queries and document collections. In traditional unigram based models, terms (or words) are usually considered to be independent. In some recent studies, dependence models have been proposed to incorporate term relationships into LM, so that links can be created between words in the same sentence, and term relationships (e.g. synonymy) can be used to expand the document model. In this study, we further extend this family of dependence models in the following two ways: (1) Term relationships are used to expand query model instead of document model, so that query expansion process can be naturally implemented; (2) We exploit more sophisticated inferential relationships extracted with Information Flow (IF). Information flow relationships are not simply pairwise term relationships as those used in previous studies, but are between a set of terms and another term. They allow for context-dependent query expansion. Our experiments conducted on TREC collections show that we can obtain large and significant improvements with our approach. This study shows that LM is an appropriate framework to implement effective query expansion.', 'venue': 'International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management', 'year': 2005, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143867241', 'name': 'Jing Bai'}, {'authorId': '48437245', 'name': 'D.

The approach extends the basic language modeling approach based on unigram by relaxing the independence assumption. We integrate the linkage of a query as a hidden variable, which expresses the term dependencies within the query as an acyclic, planar, undirected graph. We then assume that a query is generated from a document in two stages: the linkage is generated first, and then each term is generated in turn depending on other related terms according to the linkage.

For the estimation of these parameters, three different learning strategies are distinguished, namely query-related, document-related and description-related learning. As a representative for each of these strategies, a specific model is described. A new approach regards IR as uncertain inference; here, imaging is used as a new technique for estimating the probabilistic parameters, and probabilistic inference networks support more complex forms of inference.

It is repeatedly claimed that stopwords do not contribute towards the context or information of the documents and they should be removed during indexing as well as before querying by an IR system. However, the use of a single fixed stopword list across different document collections could be detrimental to the retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents different methods in deriving a stopword list automatically for a given collection and evaluates the results using four different standard TREC collections. In particular, a new approach, called term-based random sampling, is introduced based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. This approach determines how informative a term is and hence enables us to derive a stopword list automatically. This new approach is then compared to various classical approaches based on Zipf’s law, which we used as our baselines here. Results show that the stopword lists derived by the methods inspired by Zipf’s law are reliable but very expensive to carry out. On the other hand, the computational effort taken to derive the stopword lists using the new approach was minimal compared to the baseline approaches, while achieving a comparable performance. Finally, we show that a more effective stopword list can be obtained by merging the classical stopword list with the stopword lists generated by either the baselines or the new proposed approach.', 'venue': 'Journal of Digital Information Management', 'year': 2005, 'authors': [{'authorId': '153072265', 'name': 'R.

He has coauthored more than eighty papers, several of them with librarian colleagues at OHSU, and coauthored a chapter on information retrieval systems in a book on medical informatics published in 2001 [1], which provides a much abbreviated view of the topic in thirty-three pages. \\n \\nIn the seven years since the first edition of Information Retrieval, the information world has changed considerably, largely because of the Internet, a point the author notes in his preface by indicating that “this edition is profoundly re-written and is essentially a new book” (p. ix). Indeed the page count has increased by nearly 62%, although the 11 chapter headings provide a nearly identical framework, as do the appendixes. The author maintains a Website to report on errata and new developments in the field. The site also includes the full text of chapter 1, the complete bibliography, and the index. The errata page dated June 2003 contains a considerable list of both substantial errata as well as typographical errors. The update pages reflect significant new developments chapter by chapter, many of which draw from updates to a course the author teaches. This resource will be very valuable if the author is committed to maintaining it and, in fact, is already a useful site that readers can bookmark and scan periodically for their professional reading. \\n \\nThe main goal of the book is “to provide an understanding of the theory, implementation, and evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems in health and biomedicine” (p. ix). The 11 chapters are divided into three parts, which flow from basic definitions of information retrieval and an overview of health and biomedical information, to a description of the current “state-of-the-art” in information retrieval, to a discussion of the major research and development trends in building better systems. The four appendixes revolve around a sample database of documents to illustrate concepts such as inverted files. The book also includes an extensive list of about 1,050 references and a subject index. \\n \\nMost health sciences librarians will be familiar with the basic concepts introduced in chapters 1 and 2, including an excellent overview of health and biomedical information as primary or secondary literature, the peer-review process, impact factors, evidence-based medicine, electronic publishing, and quality of health information on the Web. Chapter 3 contains a summary of system research and evaluation methodology that will be particularly valuable to librarians who evaluate information systems and resources with constrained budgets. It will also help as the profession develops its own knowledgebase of evidence-based librarianship. This summary sets the stage for chapter 7, in which the author reviews existing research, primarily in the clinical arena, on questions of system use, user satisfaction, and system impact, including MEDLINE impact studies conducted by librarians. One of the author's conclusions based on research to date is that “although healthcare IR systems are widely distributed and commercially successful, their true impact on healthcare providers and patient care is unknown” (p. 261). \\n \\nChapters 4 through 6 address the state of the art in content (databases, full-text, Websites, images), indexing (controlled vocabularies, Unified Medical Language System, metadata, word indexing, Web crawling), and retrieval (search processes for different types of resources, Web search engines, information filtering). Again, most of this will be familiar territory for health sciences librarians, as it forms the basis for much of the teaching done with users. Only a brief mention is made of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's genomic resources, reflecting the book's bias toward retrieval of health care textual information as opposed to retrieval of research data. \\n \\nResearch directions are the focus of the final four chapters. Some content of these chapters will stretch the knowledgebase of practicing health sciences librarians and be of more interest to library science and informatics researchers. It introduces specialized terminology and concepts relating to developments in lexical-statistical systems, which base indexing and retrieval on word stems in text (chapter 8), and linguistics systems, which base retrieval on natural language processing (chapter 9). Chapter 10, “Augmenting Systems for Users,” describes additional methods for improving the user interface, particularly across multiple resources including linking IR systems to the electronic medical record, and it has a section on digital libraries. The section on digital libraries is very brief and may raise some hackles by stating that “probably the main function of libraries is to maintain collections of published literature” (p. 387), but the author redeems himself later by observing, “One concern about digital libraries is access to the professionals who have always aided users of physical libraries\\u2009…the value of professional assistance to users cannot be denied” (p. 389). Chapter 11 concludes the book with an introduction to the concept of information extraction, also known as text mining. The author focuses on extraction of content from the clinical narrative and briefly explores the use of information extraction techniques to facilitate scientific discovery. \\n \\nA review [2] of the first edition noted several limitations, including “the focus on medical as opposed to health sciences; the rather selective international coverage of general IR research\\u2009…,\\u2009the lack of information about medical IR systems in other countries; and the lack of coverage about issues in non-textual databases.” This statement remains largely true in the second edition, although a wider focus would have added that many more pages to an already hefty tome. \\n \\nInformation Retrieval would be a useful addition to the shelves of academic libraries for both librarians and health professionals and students, if more depth of information is desired beyond “how-to-search” manuals. The chapters on system evaluation and research trends are particularly enlightening. Schools of library and information science and informatics programs should also consider this text a must for capturing the complexity of the intersection between information retrieval and medicine.\", 'venue': '', 'year': 2005, 'authors': [{'authorId': '37906482', 'name': 'L.

The main advantage of FCA for IR is the possibility of creating a conceptual representation of a given docu- ment collection in the form of a document lattice, which may be used both to improve the retrieval of specific items and to drive the mining of the collection's contents. In this paper, we will examine the best features of FCA for solving IR tasks that could not be easily addressed by conventional systems, as well as the most critical aspects for building FCA-based IR applications. These observations have led to the development of CREDO, a system that allows the user to query Web documents and see retrieval results organized in a browsable concept lattice.

The experimental setting consists of three components: (1) the involvement of potential users as test persons; (2) the application of dynamic and individual information needs; and (3) the use of multidimensional and dynamic relevance judgements. Hidden under the information need component is the essential central sub‐component, the simulated work task situation, the tool that triggers the (simulated) dynamic information needs. This paper also reports on the empirical findings of the metaevaluation of the application of this sub‐component, the purpose of which is to discover whether the application of simulated work task situations to future evaluation of IIR systems can be recommended. Investigations are carried out to determine whether any search behavioural differences exist between test persons‘ treatment of their own real information needs versus simulated information needs. The hypothesis is that if no difference exists one can correctly substitute real information needs with simulated information needs through the application of simulated work task situations. The empirical results of the meta‐evaluation provide positive evidence for the application of simulated work task situations to the evaluation of IIR systems. The results also indicate that tailoring work task situations to the group of test persons is important in motivating them. Furthermore, the results of the evaluation show that different versions of semantic openness of the simulated situations make no difference to the test persons’ search treatment.', 'venue': 'J.

The Concept Learning model emphasizes the role of manual and automated feature selection and classifier formation in text classification. It enables drawing on results from statistics and machine learning in explaining the effectiveness of alternate representations of text, and specifies desirable characteristics of text representations. \\nThe use of syntactic parsing to produce indexing phrases has been widely investigated as a possible route to better text representations. Experiments with syntactic phrase indexing, however, have never yielded significant improvements in text retrieval performance. The Concept Learning model suggests that the poor statistical characteristics of a syntactic indexing phrase representation negate its desirable semantic characteristics. The application of term clustering to this representation to improve its statistical properties while retaining its desirable meaning properties is proposed. \\nStandard term clustering strategies from information retrieval (IR), based on cooccurrence of indexing terms in documents or groups of documents, were tested on a syntactic indexing phrase representation. In experiments using a standard text retrieval test collection, small effectiveness improvements were obtained. \\nAs a means of evaluating representation quality, a text retrieval test collection introduces a number of confounding factors. In contrast, the text categorization task allows much cleaner determination of text representation properties. In preparation for the use of text categorization to study text representation, a more effective and theoretically well-founded probabilistic text categorization algorithm was developed, building on work by Maron, Fuhr, and others. \\nText categorization experiments supported a number of predictions of the Concept Learning model about properties of phrasal representations, including dimensionality properties not previously measured for text representations. However, in carefully controlled experiments using syntactic phrases produced by Church's stochastic bracketer, in conjunction with reciprocal nearest neighbor clustering, term clustering was found to produce essentially no improvement in the properties of the phrasal representation. New cluster analysis approaches are proposed to remedy the problems found in traditional term clustering methods.\", 'venue': '', 'year': 1991, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35153517', 'name': 'D.

The main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori.

In such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate, corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms. In this paper, we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector space model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic indexing scheme.

All known PIR schemes assume that the user knows the physical address of the sought item. This is usually not the case when accessing a public database that is not managed by the user. Such databases are typically presented with keywords, which are then internally translated (at the database end) to physical addresses, using an appropriate search structure (for example, a hash table or a binary tree).

We use this framework to guide hidden annotations in order to improve the retrieval performance. For each object in the database, we maintain a list of probabilities, each indicating the probability of this object having one of the attributes. During training, the learning algorithm samples objects in the database and presents them to the annotator to assign attributes. For each sampled object, each probability is set to be one or zero depending on whether or not the corresponding attribute is assigned by the annotator. For objects that have not been annotated, the learning algorithm estimates their probabilities with biased kernel regression. Knowledge gain is then defined to determine, among the objects that have not been annotated, which one the system is the most uncertain. The system then presents it as the next sample to the annotator to which it is assigned attributes. During retrieval, the list of probabilities works as a feature vector for us to calculate the semantic distance between two objects, or between the user query and an object in the database. The overall distance between two objects is determined by a weighted sum of the semantic distance and the low-level feature distance. The algorithm is tested on both synthetic databases and real databases of 3D models. In both cases, the retrieval performance of the system improves rapidly with the number of annotated samples.

More recently, information science researchers have turned to other newer artificial-intelligence-based inductive learning techniques including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. These newer techniques, which are grounded on diverse paradigms, have provided great opportunities for researchers to enhance the information processing and retrieval capabilities of current information storage and retrieval systems. In this article, we first provide an overview of these newer techniques and their use in information science research. To familiarize readers with these techniques, we present three popular methods: the connectionist Hopfield network; the symbolic ID3/ID5R; and evolution-based genetic algorithms. We discuss their knowledge representations and algorithms in the context of information retrieval. Sample implementation and testing results from our own research are also provided for each technique. We believe these techniques are promising in their ability to analyze user queries, identify users' information needs, and suggest alternatives for search.

As a special case, we present a two-stage smoothing method that allows us to estimate the smoothing parameters completely automatically. In the first stage, the document language model is smoothed using a Dirichlet prior with the collection language model as the reference model. In the second stage, the smoothed document language model is further interpolated with a query background language model. We propose a leave-one-out method for estimating the Dirichlet parameter of the first stage, and the use of document mixture models for estimating the interpolation parameter of the second stage.

However, the replacement of such systems would be much more costly than their evolution through the incorporation of new features to enhance their efficiency and effectiveness. Previous efforts in this area have led to the introduction of numeric weights to improve both document representation and query language. By attaching a numeric weight to a term in a query, a user can provide a quantitative description of the “importance” of that term in the documents he or she is looking for. However, the use of weights requires a clear knowledge of their semantics for translating a fuzzy concept into a precise numeric value. Our acquaintance with these problems led us to define, starting from an existing weighted Boolean retrieval model, a linguistic extension, formalized within fuzzy set theory, in which numeric query weights are replaced by linguistic descriptors which specify the degree of importance of the terms. This fuzzy linguistic model is defined and an evaluation is made of its implementation on a Boolean IRS. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.', 'venue': 'Journal of the American Society for Information Science', 'year': 1993, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2637401', 'name': 'Gloria Bordogna'}, {'authorId': '145645971', 'name': 'G.

Therefore, LDM is a means of melding discriminative and generative models for IR. We present two algorithms of parameter learning for LDM. One is to optimize the average precision (AP) directly using an iterative procedure. The other is a perceptron-based algorithm that minimizes the number of discordant document-pairs in a rank list. The effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated on the task of ad hoc retrieval using six English and Chinese TREC test sets. Results show that (1) in most test sets, LDM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art language modeling approaches and the classical probabilistic retrieval model; (2) it is more appropriate to train LDM using a measure of AP rather than likelihood if the IR system is graded on AP; and (3) linguistic features (e.g. phrases and dependences) are effective for IR if they are incorporated properly.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2005, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1800422', 'name': 'Jianfeng Gao'}, {'authorId': '1787923', 'name': 'Haoliang Qi'}, {'authorId': '1814416', 'name': 'Xinsong Xia'}, {'authorId': '143619007', 'name': 'Jian-Yun Nie'}]}\n",

The retrieval system can actively probe a user with questions to clarify the information need instead of just passively responding to user queries. A basic question is thus how a retrieval system should propose questions to the user so that it can obtain maximum benefits from the feedback on these questions. In this paper, we study how a retrieval system can perform active feedback, i.e., how to choose documents for relevance feedback so that the system can learn most from the feedback information. We present a general framework for such an active feedback problem, and derive several practical algorithms as special cases. Empirical evaluation of these algorithms shows that the performance of traditional relevance feedback (presenting the top K documents) is consistently worse than that of presenting documents with more diversity. With a diversity-based selection algorithm, we obtain fewer relevant documents, however, these fewer documents have more learning benefits.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2005, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2900084', 'name': 'Xuehua Shen'}, {'authorId': '1736467', 'name': 'ChengXiang Zhai'}]}\n",

One way to deal with OOV words when the two languages have different alphabets, is to transliterate the unknown words, that is, to render them in the orthography of the second language. In the present study, we present a simple statistical technique to train an English to Arabic transliteration model from pairs of names. We call this a selected n-gram model because a two-stage training procedure first learns which n-gram segments should be added to the unigram inventory for the source language, and then a second stage learns the translation model over this inventory. This technique requires no heuristics or linguistic knowledge of either language. We evaluate the statistically-trained model and a simpler hand-crafted model on a test set of named entities from the Arabic AFP corpus and demonstrate that they perform better than two online translation sources. We also explore the effectiveness of these systems on the TREC 2002 cross language IR task.

Symbolic representations such as MIDI allow the easy calculation of such information and its manipulation. In contrast, most of the existing work in Audio MIR uses timbral and beat information, which can be calculated using automatic computer audition techniques. In this paper, Pitch Histograms are defined and proposed as a way to represent the pitch content of music signals both in symbolic and audio form. This representation is evaluated in the context of automatic musical genre classification. A multiple-pitch detection algorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch Histograms for audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and significance of errors resulting from the automatic multiple-pitch detection, automatic musical genre classification results from symbolic and audio data are compared. The comparison indicates that Pitch Histograms provide valuable information for musical genre classification. The results obtained for both symbolic and audio cases indicate that although pitch errors degrade classification performance for the audio case, Pitch Histograms can be effectively used for classification in both cases.', 'venue': 'International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference', 'year': 2003, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1693065', 'name': 'G.

These advantages are further demonstrated through a map display generated by a neural network's self-organizing algorithm. The map display detects complex relationships among given documents, and reveals the relationships through a spatial arrangement of terms abstracted from the documents. The map display also provides interactive tools to allow the user to interact with the underlying information. Examples of the map displays show that such map displays can be used both as an overview tool and an access or exploration tool, and the map displays will likely increase the amount of information that the user is willing to browse.\", 'venue': 'Journal of the American Society for Information Science', 'year': 1997, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145724540', 'name': 'Xia Lin'}]}\n",

Our sense tagger is crude, but performs consistent disambiguation by considering only the single most informative word as evidence to disambiguate the target word.

Providing large-scale Information Retrieval (IR), e.g. for searching the Word Wide Web, is an appealing application for P2P systems. The research community has presented several proposal for P2P-IR. However, so far the concepts of P2P and of IR have been intermingled. In this paper, we propose an architecture to structure P2P-IR systems. We differentiate between concepts belonging to the construction and maintenance of a P2P overlay network, and those belonging to IR. Furthermore, we distinguish basic P2P-IR concepts, which are likely to be needed in all P2P-IR systems, and advanced P2P-IR concepts, that rather depend on the flavor of the system. This decomposition of the P2P retrieval process is an important step towards a structured implementation of such systems. Furthermore, it allows a systematic sharing of methods and resources needed to perform retrieval.

Previously index terms have been assumed to be independent for the good reason that then a very simple weighting scheme can be used. In reality index terms are most unlikely to be independent. This paper explores one way of removing the independence assumption. Instead the extent of the dependence between index terms is measured and used to construct a non‐linear weighting function. In a practical situation the values of some of the parameters of such a function must be estimated from small samples of documents. So a number of estimation rules are discussed and one in particular is recommended. Finally the feasibility of the computations required for a non‐linear weighting scheme is examined.', 'venue': '', 'year': 1977, 'authors': [{'authorId': '121352283', 'name': 'Van Rijsbergen'}]}\n",

After reviewing both user experiences described in IR and GSS literature and observing and interviewing users of existing IR and GSS commercial and prototype systems, the authors conclude that there is an obvious demand for systems supporting multi-user IR.

The dramatic development and growth of online services since then seems not to have been accompanied by much interest in these conceptual problems, the limits they appear to impose, or the potential for transcending such limits through more creative use of the new services. In this article, I offer a personal perspective on automatic indexing and information retrieval, focusing not necessarily on the mainstream of research but on those events and ideas over a 34-year period that have led to the view stated above, and that have influenced my perception of important directions for future research. Some experimental tests of information systems have yielded good retrieval results and some very poor results. I shall explain why I think that occurred, why I believe that the poor results merit special attention, and why we should reconsider a suggestion that Robert Fairthome put forward in 1963 to develop postulates of impotence—statements of what cannot be done.

We note that the architectures of both spaces effect the ease with which one can apply various information retrieval algorithms. We identify a number of different index space and document space architectures and we discuss some of the associated trade-offs between hypertext functionality and computational complexity.

The network supports adaptation of connection weights as well as the growing of new edges between queries and terms based on user relevance feedback data for training, and it reflects query modification and expansion in information retrieval. A learning rule is applied that can also be viewed as supporting sequential learning using a harmonic sequence learning rate. Experimental results with four standard small collections and a large Wall Street Journal collection (173,219 documents) show that performance of feedback improves substantially over no feedback, and further gains are obtained when queries are expanded with terms from the feedback documents. The effect is much more pronounced in small collections than in the large collection. Query expansion may be considered as a tool for both precision and recall enhancement. In particular, small query expansion levels of about 30 terms can achieve most of the gains at the low-recall high-precision region, while larger expansion levels continue to provide gains at the high-recall low-precision region of a precision recall curve.', 'venue': 'TOIS', 'year': 1995, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145219946', 'name': 'K.

Thereby in this paper we investigate why the use of WordNet has not been successful. Based on this analysis we propose a method of making WordNet more useful in information retrieval applications. Experiments using several standard information retrieval test collections show that our method results in a significant improvement of information retrieval performance. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Development of WordNet began in 1985 at Princeton University (Miller, 1990). A team lead by Prof. George Miller aimed to create a source of lexical knowledge whose organization would reflect some of the recent findings of psycholinguistic research into the human lexicon. WordNet has been used in numerous natural language processing, such as part of speech tagging (Segond et al., 97), word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), text categorization (Gomez-Hidalgo and Rodriguez, 1997), information extraction (Chai and Biermann, 1997), and so on with considerable success. However the usefulness of WordNet in information retrieval applications has been debatable. Information retrieval is concerned with locating documents relevant to a user's information needs from a collection of documents. The user describes his/her information needs with a query which consists of a number of words. The information retrieval system compares the query with documents in the collection and returns the documents that are likely to satisfy the user's information requirements. A fundamental weakness of current information retrieval methods is that the vocabulary that searchers use is often not the same as the one by which the information has been indexed. Query expansion is one method to solve this problem. The query is expanded using terms which have similar meaning or bear some relation to those in the query, increasing the chances of matching words in relevant documents. Expanded terms are generally taken from a thesaurus. Obviously, given a query, the information retrieval system must present all useful articles to the user. This objective is measured by recall, i.e. the proportion of relevant articles retrieved by the system. Conversely, the information retrieval system must not present any useless article to the user. This criteria is measured by precision, i.e. the proportion of retrieved articles that are relevant. Voorhees used WordNet as a tool for query expansion (Voorhees, 1994). She conducted experiments using the TREC collection (Voorhees and Harman, 1997) in which all terms in the queries were expanded using a combination of synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. She set the weights of the words contained in the original query to 1, and used a combination of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 2 for the expansion terms. She then used the SMART Information Retrieval System Engine (Salton, 1971) to retrieve the documents. Through this method, Voorhees only succeeded in improving the performance on short queries and a tittle with no significant improvement for long queries. She further tried to use WordNet as a tool for word sense disambiguation (Voorhees, 1993) and applied it to text retrieval, but the performance of retrieval was degraded. Stairmand (Stairmand, 1997) used WordNet to compute lexical cohesion according to the method suggested by Morris (Morris and Hirst, 199 I), and applied this to information retrieval.\", 'venue': 'WordNet@ACL/COLING', 'year': 1998, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1921454', 'name': 'Rila Mandala'}, {'authorId': '37090109', 'name': 'T.

By using default independence assumptions with explicit specification of disjoint events, the inference process always yields point probabilities.

The main thrust of this project is to use natural language processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of full-text document retrieval. Since our first TREC entry in 1992 (as NYU team) the basic premise of our research was to demonstrate that robust if relatively shallow NLP can help to derive a better representation of text documents for statistical search. TREC-5 marks a shift in this approach away from text representation issues and towards query development problems. While our TREC-5 system still performs extensive text processing in order to extract phrasal and other indexing terms, our main focus this year was on query construction using words, sentences, and entire passages to expand initial topic specifications in an attempt to cover their various angles, aspects and contexts. Based on our earlier TREC results indicating that NLP is more effective when long, descriptive queries are used, we allowed for liberal expansion with long passages from related documents imported verbatim into the queries. This method appears to have produced a dramatic improvement in the performance of two different statistical search engines that we tested (Cornell’s SMART and NIST’s Prise) boosting the average precision by at least 40%. \\n \\nThe overall architecture of TREC-5 system has also changed in a number of ways from TREC-4. The most notable new feature is the stream architecture in which several independent, parallel indexes are built for a given collection, each index reflecting a different representation strategy for text documents. Stream indexes are built using a mixture of different indexing approaches, term extracting, and weighting strategies. We used both SMART and Prise base indexing engines, and selected optimal term weighting strategies for each stream, based on a training collection of approximately 500 MBytes. The final results are produced by a merging procedure that combines ranked list of documents obtained by searching all stream indexes with appropriately preprocessed queries. This allows for an effective combination of alternative retrieval and filtering methods, creating into a meta-search where the contribution of each stream can be optimized through training.', 'venue': 'Text Retrieval Conference', 'year': 1994, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1791072', 'name': 'T.

Realizing that the design of an effective recognition architecture requires careful consideration of the interplay between feature selection, feature representation, and similarity function, we start by searching for a performance criteria that can simultaneously guide the design of all three components. A natural solution is to formulate visual recognition as a decision theoretical problem, where the goal is to minimize the probability of retrieval error. This leads to a Bayesian architecture that is shown to generalize a significant number of previous recognition approaches, solving some of the most challenging problems faced by these: joint modeling of color and texture, objective guidelines for controlling the trade-off between feature transformation and feature representation, and unified support for local and global queries without requiring image segmentation. The new architecture is shown to perform well on color, texture, and generic image databases, providing a good trade-off between retrieval accuracy, invariance, perceptual relevance of similarity judgments, and complexity. \\nBecause all that is needed to perform optimal Bayesian decisions is the ability to evaluate beliefs on the different hypothesis under consideration, a Bayesian architecture is not restricted to visual recognition. On the contrary, it establishes a universal recognition language (the language of probabilities) that provides a computational basis for the integration of information from multiple content sources and modalities. In result, it becomes possible to build retrieval systems that can simultaneously account for text, audio, video, or any other content modalities. \\nSince the ability to learn follows from the ability to integrate information over time, this language is also conducive to the design of learning algorithms. We show that learning is, indeed, an important asset for visual information retrieval by designing both short and long-term learning mechanisms. Over short time scales (within a retrieval session), learning is shown to assure faster convergence to the desired target images. Over long time scales (between retrieval sessions), it allows the retrieval system to tailor itself to the preferences of particular users. In both cases, all the necessary computations are carried out through Bayesian belief propagation algorithms that, although optimal in a decision-theoretic sense, are extremely simple, intuitive, and easy to implement.

Obviously, a single XML document may represent more than one of these aspects, so for querying XML we need a query language which takes into account all these aspects.

Many attempts have been made to come up with some sensible and intuitively acceptable definition of information; up to now, none of these have succeeded. This work is based on the approach followed by Dretske, Barwise, and Devlin, who claimed that the notion of information starts from the position that given an ontology of objects individuated by a cognitive agent, it makes sense to speak of the information an object (e.g., a text, an image, a video) contains about another object (e.g., the query). This phenomenon is captured by the flow of information between objects. Its exploitation is the task of an Information Retrieval system. These authors proposed a theory of information that provides an analysis of the concept of information (any type, from any media) and the manner in which intelligent organisms (referred to as cognitive agents) handle and respond to the information picked up from their environment. They defined the nature of information flow and the mechanisms that give rise to such a flow. The theory, which is based on Situation Theory, is expressed with a calculus defined on channels. The calculus was defined so that it satisfies properties that are attributed to information and its flows. This paper demonstrates the connection between this calculus and Information Retrieval, and proposes a model of an Information Retrieval system based on this calculus. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.', 'venue': 'Journal of the American Society for Information Science', 'year': 1996, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1709413', 'name': 'C.

With the popularity of the concept of 'intelligent agents', it appears that the idea of intelligent information retrieval is again in general vogue. In this paper, I attempt to show that the naive concept of intelligent information retrieval, based on the idea of agency, misses the essence of intelligence in the information retrieval system, and will inevitably lead to dysfunctional information retrieval. As a counter-proposal, I suggest that true intelligence in information retrieval resides in appropriate allocation of responsibility amongst all the actors in the information retrieval system, and that intelligent information retrieval will be achieved through effective support of people in their various interactions with information. 1. What could we mean by intelligent information retrieval? Intelligent information retrieval (IR) has been variously defined by different people, but a consistent theme has been one of the machine (or program) doing something for the user, or the machine (or program) taking over some functions that previously had to be performed by humans (either user or intermediary). So, for instance, for Belkin et al. 87, an intelligent IR system was one in which the functions of the human intermediary were performed by a program, interacting with the human user. For Maes 94, on the other hand, intelligent IR is performed by a computer program (a so-called intelligent agent), which, acting on (perhaps minimal or even no explicit) instructions from a human user, retrieves and presents information to the user without any other interaction. Croft 87, introducing the Information Processing and Management Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence and Information Retrieval, suggests that intelligent IR is just good IR, meaning that it is inappropriate to ascribe intelligence to computer programs, and also meaning that good IR is that in which the programs (i.e. the representation, comparison and interaction methods implemented in the system) result in effective performance. In all of these constructions, there is some idea that the intelligence (or goodness) of an intelligent IR system resides in the built system. Indeed, it is assumed by almost all people who have commented on intelligent IR, that the IR system is only the built system. In this paper, following Belkin et al. 83 and Belkin 93, I will argue that this assumption is, in itself, erroneous, that it has led to an inappropriate conception of what constitutes IR, and in particular, for * Currently Fulbright Fellow, Department of Information Studies, University of Tampere, P.O. Box 607, FIN3101 Tampere, tel: +358 31 215 7039, email lonibe@kielo.uta.fi Intelligent Information Retrieval 2 our purposes, has misconstrued the nature of intelligence in the IR system. Furthermore, following Bates 90, Belkin and Vickery 85, and Ingwersen 92 I will suggest both that interaction with information is the key to understanding intelligence in IR, and also that a fundamental problem for intelligent IR is how much, and what kind of support to offer users for such interaction. 2. What constitutes an information retrieval system? IR systems are often construed as some collection of components and processes which take input, as a query to the system and as texts or information collected by the system, represent those inputs, compare them, and produce, as output, some set of texts or information objects predicted to be responsive to the query. I, and many others, have argued that it is a mistake to consider the IR system as only the built system. For extended argument on this issue, see Belkin 84. The crux of the issue is that, in order properly to consider all that happens in IR, and in order properly to evaluate the performance of IR systems, the boundary of the IR system must be outside the user, including the user within the IR system. From this point of view, the IR system consists of three major components: the user in the system; the knowledge resource to which the user has access and with which s/he interacts; and, some person(s) and/or device(s) which supports and mediates the user's interactions with the knowledge resource (the intermediary). The processes which are then considered to be significant within most conceptions of the IR system are: representation (of user’s information problem, of texts in the knowledge resource: e.g. indexing); comparison (of representations of information problem and texts: e.g. retrieval techniques); interaction (between user and intermediary: e.g. reference interview or human-computer interaction); and, sometimes, judgment t (of appropriateness of text to information problem, by the user: e.g. relevance judgments); and modification (of representation of information problem: e.g. relevance feedback or query reformulation). Belkin 84, Belkin et al. 83 and Ingwersen 92, for instance, have elaborated this general model of the IR system in several ways, primarily through being more explicit and detailed about the components, by extending the range of the different processes, by specifying how the processes are carried out, and especially by considering the nature of interaction in the IR system in much more detail. In particular, Ingwersen and Wormell 86 have suggested that it is appropriate to consider the direct interaction between user and text as a separate form of interaction, and this idea has been taken up in a more fundamental sense by Belkin 93, who suggests that IR should be considered explicitly as a form of interaction with information. But in general, such elaborations have tended merely to extend somewhat the range of the IR system, without significantly changing the concept of the IR system itself. Thus, under this type of model, we understand the IR system to be composed of the components of user, intermediary and knowledge resource, related to one another by the processes of representation, comparison, interaction, judgment and modification. The significant point in this model, for Intelligent Information Retrieval 3 our purposes here, is that interaction, judgment and modification are inherent aspects of the IR system, and that the user is an inherent component of that system, not just some entity outside it, giving input and evaluating output. 3. Where could intelligence be manifest in an information retrieval system? The inclusion of the user in the IR system, and the incorporation of interaction as a major process in IR, have some significant implications for how we might consider what would constitute intelligence in an IR system. For instance, under this view, the idea of the ‘intelligent agent’ seems untenable, at least in its most straightforward sense. That is, a program which takes a query as input, and returns documents as output, without affording the opportunity for judgment, modification and especially interaction with text, or with the program, is one which would not qualify as an IR system at all. In particular, such a program would fail to know about the user’s information problem (relying only upon the query, some poor representation of that problem), and would fail to incorporate that one process which is known to improve retrieval performance significantly, interaction (especially, but not exclusively, through relevance feedback). So, although we might say that the representation and comparison processes might be performed well, and even ‘intelligently’, the system as a whole would not perform intelligently (if by that, we mean well, or effectively). Another point which this view of the IR system raises is that there are some processes in the IR system which cannot be performed by any other component than the user. In particular, interaction is a joint process of user with the other components (also of the other components with one another), and judgment is a process which can only be performed by the user. Furthermore, although modification is something that can be done by the other components of the system with reference to modifying query or text representation, modification of understanding of the information problem is something that can realistically be done only by the user. Thus, the idea of the ‘intelligent intermediary’ as being the basis of intelligent IR, although perhaps necessary, is not sufficient to characterize the complete intelligent IR system. Similarly, the idea of good IR as being effective IR fails if all the intelligence is concentrated in only the built system, since it thereby excludes the most significant aspect of effectiveness, the user’s judgment of the comparison performance. These arguments lead us to the position that intelligence in intelligent IR perhaps resides not only in that which is built to support the user, but also in the user her/himself, and in particular in proper assignment of roles and responsibilities to all of the various components of the IR system. Clearly, some of the processes we have mentioned must be carried out by the components in concert, and some knowledge on which they are based (for instance, knowledge of database structure and contents) might be privileged to only one of the built components. Thus, there is some sense in which we might say that doing these processes (or applying such knowledge) well is important to intelligent IR. However, this view does not incorporate the undoubted intelligence of the user, in particular in respect of the judgment, modification and interaction processes. Thus, we might say that a role of the user is to judge or evaluate the texts with respect to the information problem; a role of the intermediary is to offer to the user interesting texts with which to interact; and a role of the knowledge resource is to be organized in such a way as to promote effective interaction. These are only examples of the roles and res\", 'venue': 'Intelligence and Security Informatics', 'year': 1996, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2095083', 'name': 'N. Belkin'}]}\n",

The problem is seen as presenting a chronic dilemma for the field. This dilemma has taken three forms as the discipline has evolved: (1) The dilemma of measurement in the archetypal approach: Stated relevance versus user relevance; (2) the dilemma of measurement in the probabilistic approach: Realism versus formalism; and (3) the dilemma of measurement in the Information Retrieval‐Expert System (IR‐ES) approach: Linear measures of relevance versus logarithmic measures of knowledge. It is argued that the dilemma of measurement has remained intractable even given the different assumptions of the different approaches for three connected reasons—the nature of the subject matter of the field; the nature of relevance judgment; and the nature of cognition and knowledge. Finally, it is concluded that the original vision of information retrieval research as a discipline founded on quantification proved restricting for its theoretical and methodological development and that increasing recognition of this is reflected in growing interest in qualitative methods in information retrieval research in relation to the cognitive, behavioral, and affective aspects of the information retrieval interaction. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.', 'venue': 'Journal of the American Society for Information Science', 'year': 1996, 'authors': [{'authorId': '46754669', 'name': 'D.

The recent advances in computing power and network connectivity have made large amounts of raw digital audio data available in the form of unstructured monolithic sound files. In this work the focus is on tools that work directly on real world audio data without attempting to transcribe the music. To distinguish from symbolic−based music IR for the remainder of the paper we use the term audio IR (AIR) to refer to techniques that work directly on raw audio signals. Obviously these signals can contain music as well as other types of audio like speech. We describe a series of tools based on current and newly developed techniques for AIR integrated under MARSYAS, our framework for audio analysis. For related work refer to (Foote, 1999). The tools developed are based on Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Visualization techniques. Finally, due to the immature state of the available techniques and to the inherent complexity of the task it is important to take advantage of the human user in the system. We have developed two user interfaces to integrate and improve our techniques: an augmented sound editor and TimbreGrams a novel graphical representation for soundfiles. The previously unpublished contributions of this paper are the genre classification method, the segmentation− based retrieval and summarization, and the definition of the TimbreGram. Feature−based audio analysis The developed analysis tools are based on the calculation of short−time feature vectors. The signal is processed in small chunks so that its statistical characteristics are relativily stable. For each chunk some form of spectral analysis is performed and based on that analysis a vector of feature values is calculated. In our system features based on FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis, MPEG filterbank analysis, LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and MFCC (Mel−Frequency cepstrum coefficients) are supported. In addition derivatives and running statistics are used to express temporal changes. The flexible architecture of MARSYAS allows the easy integration and experimentation of new features.

Realizing that the design of an effective recognition architecture requires careful consideration of the interplay between feature selection, feature representation, and similarity function, we start by searching for a performance criteria that can simultaneously guide the design of all three components. A natural solution is to formulate visual recognition as a decision theoretical problem, where the goal is to minimize the probability of retrieval error. This leads to a Bayesian architecture that is shown to generalize a significant number of previous recognition approaches, solving some of the most challenging problems faced by these: joint modeling of color and texture, objective guidelines for controlling the trade-off between feature transformation and feature representation, and unified support for local and global queries without requiring image segmentation. The new architecture is shown to perform well on color, texture, and generic image databases, providing a good trade-off between retrieval accuracy, invariance, perceptual relevance of similarity judgments, and complexity. \\nBecause all that is needed to perform optimal Bayesian decisions is the ability to evaluate beliefs on the different hypothesis under consideration, a Bayesian architecture is not restricted to visual recognition. On the contrary, it establishes a universal recognition language (the language of probabilities) that provides a computational basis for the integration of information from multiple content sources and modalities. In result, it becomes possible to build retrieval systems that can simultaneously account for text, audio, video, or any other content modalities. \\nSince the ability to learn follows from the ability to integrate information over time, this language is also conducive to the design of learning algorithms. We show that learning is, indeed, an important asset for visual information retrieval by designing both short and long-term learning mechanisms. Over short time scales (within a retrieval session), learning is shown to assure faster convergence to the desired target images. Over long time scales (between retrieval sessions), it allows the retrieval system to tailor itself to the preferences of particular users. In both cases, all the necessary computations are carried out through Bayesian belief propagation algorithms that, although optimal in a decision-theoretic sense, are extremely simple, intuitive, and easy to implement.

Thereby in this paper we investigate why the use of WordNet has not been successful. Based on this analysis we propose a method of making WordNet more useful in information retrieval applications. Experiments using several standard information retrieval test collections show that our method results in a significant improvement of information retrieval performance. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Development of WordNet began in 1985 at Princeton University (Miller, 1990). A team lead by Prof. George Miller aimed to create a source of lexical knowledge whose organization would reflect some of the recent findings of psycholinguistic research into the human lexicon. WordNet has been used in numerous natural language processing, such as part of speech tagging (Segond et al., 97), word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), text categorization (Gomez-Hidalgo and Rodriguez, 1997), information extraction (Chai and Biermann, 1997), and so on with considerable success. However the usefulness of WordNet in information retrieval applications has been debatable. Information retrieval is concerned with locating documents relevant to a user's information needs from a collection of documents. The user describes his/her information needs with a query which consists of a number of words. The information retrieval system compares the query with documents in the collection and returns the documents that are likely to satisfy the user's information requirements. A fundamental weakness of current information retrieval methods is that the vocabulary that searchers use is often not the same as the one by which the information has been indexed. Query expansion is one method to solve this problem. The query is expanded using terms which have similar meaning or bear some relation to those in the query, increasing the chances of matching words in relevant documents. Expanded terms are generally taken from a thesaurus. Obviously, given a query, the information retrieval system must present all useful articles to the user. This objective is measured by recall, i.e. the proportion of relevant articles retrieved by the system. Conversely, the information retrieval system must not present any useless article to the user. This criteria is measured by precision, i.e. the proportion of retrieved articles that are relevant. Voorhees used WordNet as a tool for query expansion (Voorhees, 1994). She conducted experiments using the TREC collection (Voorhees and Harman, 1997) in which all terms in the queries were expanded using a combination of synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. She set the weights of the words contained in the original query to 1, and used a combination of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 2 for the expansion terms. She then used the SMART Information Retrieval System Engine (Salton, 1971) to retrieve the documents. Through this method, Voorhees only succeeded in improving the performance on short queries and a tittle with no significant improvement for long queries. She further tried to use WordNet as a tool for word sense disambiguation (Voorhees, 1993) and applied it to text retrieval, but the performance of retrieval was degraded. Stairmand (Stairmand, 1997) used WordNet to compute lexical cohesion according to the method suggested by Morris (Morris and Hirst, 199 I), and applied this to information retrieval.\", 'venue': 'WordNet@ACL/COLING', 'year': 1998, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1921454', 'name': 'Rila Mandala'}, {'authorId': '37090109', 'name': 'T.

Special rules are also designed to recognize and normalize special words such as proper names and nominal pre-determiners. Our experiments show that IR based on this segmentation gives a slightly higher effectiveness than bigrams. In addition, it requires less time and space for document and query processing. We also tested combinations of words with bigrams in IR and using top-ranked documents for query expansion.

Methods: Our study focused on consumer queries that were used on a consumer health service Web site and a consumer health information Web site. We analyzed data from the site-usage logs and conducted interviews with patients. Results: Our findings show that consumers’ information retrieval performance is very poor. There are significant mismatches at all levels (lexical, semantic and mental models) between the consumer terminology and both the information source terminology and standard medical vocabularies.

The paper shows the existence of efficient retrieval algorithms that only use the matching terms in their computation. Under these conditions, the language models of information retrieval are surprisingly similar to both tf.idf term weighting as developed for the vector space model and relevance weighting as developed in the traditional probabilistic model.

Equally interesting is the fact that observations of user experiences with group support systems (GSS) reveal that although access to external information and the ability to search for relevant material is often vital to the progress of GSS sessions, integrated support for collaborative searching and visualization of results is lacking in GSS systems. After reviewing both user experiences described in IR and GSS literature and observing and interviewing users of existing IR and GSS commercial and prototype systems, the authors conclude that there is an obvious demand for systems supporting multi-user IR. It is surprising to the authors that very little attention has been given to the common ground shared by these two important research domains. With this in mind, our paper describes how user experiences with IR and GSS systems have shed light on a promising new area of collaborative research and led to the development of a prototype that merges the two paradigms into a collaborative information retrieval environment (CIRE).

Indeed, it is even difficult, if not impossible, to predict a model's empirical performance analytically. This limitation is at least partly caused by the way existing retrieval models are developed where relevance is only coarsely modeled at the level of documents and queries as opposed to a finer granularity level of terms. In this paper, we present a new axiomatic approach to developing retrieval models based on direct modeling of relevance with formalized retrieval constraints defined at the level of terms. The basic idea of this axiomatic approach is to search in a space of candidate retrieval functions for one that can satisfy a set of reasonable retrieval constraints. To constrain the search space, we propose to define a retrieval function inductively and decompose a retrieval function into three component functions. Inspired by the analysis of the existing retrieval functions with the inductive definition, we derive several new retrieval functions using the axiomatic retrieval framework. Experiment results show that the derived new retrieval functions are more robust and less sensitive to parameter settings than the existing retrieval functions with comparable optimal performance.\", 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2005, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145344526', 'name': 'H.

These systems will have to analyze and understand both new text and Natural Language queries. In answering questions, they will have to direct memory search to reasonable places. This requires good organization of both the conceptual content of text and knowledge necessary for understanding those texts and accessing memory. The CYRUS and FRUMP systems (Kolodner (1978), Schank and Kolodner (1979), Dejong (1979)) comprise an information retrieval system called CyFr. Together, they have the analysis and retrieval capabilities mentioned above. FRUMP analysis news stories from the UPI wire for their conceptual content, and produces summaries of those stories. It sends summaries of stories about important people to CYRUS automatically adds those stories to its memory, and can then retrieve that information to answer question posed to it in natural language. This paper describes the problems involved in building such an intelligent system. It proposes solutions to some of those problems bases on recent research in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language processing, and describes the CyFr system, which implements those solutions. The solutions we propose and implement are based on a model of human understanding and memory retrieval.

According to a recent study (Lawrence & Giles, 1999) there are 180 million images on the publicly indexable Web, a total amount of image data of about 3Tb [terabytes], and an astounding one million or more digital images are being produced every day (Jain, 93). The need to find a desired image from a collection is shared by many groups, including journalists, engineers, historians, designers, teachers, artists, and advertising agencies. Image needs and uses across users in these groups vary considerably. Users may require access to images based on primitive features such as color, texture or shape or users may require access to images based on abstract concepts and symbolic imagery. The technology to access these images has also accelerated phenomenally and at present surpasses our understanding of how users interact with visual information. This paper provides an overview of current research in image information retrieval and provides an outline of areas for future research. The approach is broad and interdisciplinary and focuses on three aspects of image research (IR): text-based retrieval, content-based retrieval, and user interactions with image information retrieval systems. The review concludes with a call for image retrieval evaluation studies similar to TREC. Text-Based Image Retrieval Research Most existing IR systems are text-based, but images frequently have little or no accompanying textual information. The solution historically has been to develop text-based ontologies and classification schemes for image description. Text-based indexing has many strengths including the ability to represent both general and specific instantiations of an object at varying levels of complexity. Reviews of the literature pertaining primarily to text-based approaches include Rasmussen (1997) Lancaster (1998) Lunin (1987) and Cawkell (1993). Long before images could be digitized, access to image collections was provided by librarians, curators, and archivists through text descriptors or classification codes. These indexing schemes were often developed in-house and reflect the unique characteristics of a particular collection or clientele. This is still common practice and recently Zheng (1999) and Goodrum & Martin (1997) have reported on the hybridization of multiple schemas for classifying collections of historic costume collections. Hourihane (1989) has also reviewed a number of these unique systems for image classification. To date, very little research has been conducted on the relative effectiveness of these various approaches to image indexing in electronic environments. Attempts to provide general systems for image indexing include the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), which consists of over 120,000 terms for the description of art, art history, architecture, and other cultural objects, and the Library of Congress Thesaurus of Graphic Materials (LCTGM). The AAT currently provides access to thirty-three hierarchical categories of image description using seven broad facets (Associated Concepts, Physical Attributes, Styles and Periods, Agents, Activities, Materials, and Objects). The approach in many collections, particularly general library environments, has been to apply an existing cataloging system like the Dewey Decimal System to image description using the LCTGM, or ICONCLASS. Assignment of terms to describe images is not solved entirely by the use of controlled vocabularies or classification schemes however. The textual representation of images is problematic because images convey information relating to what is actually depicted in the image as well as what the image is about. Shatford (1986) posits this discussion within a framework based on Panofsky's approach to analyzing iconographical levels of meaning in images (1955). …\", 'venue': 'Informing Sci. Int. J. an Emerg.

The system uses a generative model to estimate the probability that a document in one language is relevant, given a query in another language. An important component of the model is translation probabilities from terms in documents to terms in a query. Our approach is evaluated when 1) the only resource is a manually generated bilingual word list, 2) the only resource is a parallel corpus, and 3) both resources are combined in a mixture model. The combined resources produce about 90% of monolingual performance in retrieving Chinese documents. For Spanish the system achieves 85% of monolingual performance using only a pseudo-parallel Spanish-English corpus. Retrieval results are comparable with those of the structural query translation technique (Pirkola, 1998) when bilingual lexicons are used for query translation. When parallel texts in addition to conventional lexicons are used, it achieves better retrieval results but requires more computation than the structural query translation technique.

The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request. Like all other documentalists who are operating large coordinate indexes, we are searching for better ways to exploit this type of information system. In our library we have already eliminated the time-consuming job of posting document numbers manually by enlisting the aid of a 705 computer. (The computer periodically prepares revised posting cards to replace the outdated ones.) Now we are searching for better solutions to our retrieval problems. One obvious retrieval problem in any large system is the time required to \"coordinate\" heavily posted terms. We are convinced we must mechanize if we are to allow our collection to grow indefinitely. A second problem is the retrieval of so many documents related to a single request that the customer finds it difficult to decide which to examine first. Since he has no precise means of determining which document is most closely related to a request, we have been forced into assisting him to use somewhat arbitrary or subjective means. The date of the document is sometimes used as a relevance criterion with the hope that the most recent document will be the most pertinent, or the name of the author is used with the hope that a known author will answer the request better than an unknown one.

Music is used for an extraordinary variety of purposes: the restaurateur seeks music that targets a certain clientele; the aerobics instructor seeks a certain tempo; the film director seeks music conveying a certain mood; an advertiser seeks a tune that is highly memorable; the physiotherapist seeks music that will motivate a patient; the truck driver seeks music that will keep him/her alert. Although there are many other uses for music, music’s preeminent functions are social and psychological. The most useful retrieval indexes are those that facilitate searching according to such social and psychological functions. Typically, such indexes will focus on stylistic, mood, and similarity information. In attempting to build such musical indexes, two general questions arise: (1) What is the best taxonomic system by which to classify moods, styles, and other musical characteristics? (2) How can we create automated systems that will reliably characterize recordings or scores? Internet-based music distribution has brought these two questions to the fore. In the case of proprietary musical databases, the second problem can be centrally managed, and perhaps addressed using manual methods. However, past experience with Internet access to text documents implies that non-proprietary decentralized indexing is likely to prove more popular and successful. That is, future music indexes will likely resemble web-wide search engines (like Infoseek or Google) rather than closed proprietary systems (like Beatscape or Encyclopedia Britannica). The problem of building musical web crawlers that traverse the web and index music-related files (such as MP3) should prove challenging. The enabling technology for such musical web crawlers will need to draw extensively on research in music perception and cognition. Consider two sample problems: music summarization and mood characterization.', 'venue': 'International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference', 'year': 2000, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3097756', 'name': 'David Huron'}]}\n",

Its interpretation in the context of a ‘possible worlds’ semantics is very appealing for ir. In 1989, Van Rijsbergen suggested its use for solving one of the fundamental problems of logical models of IR: the evaluation of the implication d → q (where d and q are respectively a document and a query representation). Since then, others have tried to follow that suggestion proposing models and applications, though without much success. Most of these approaches had as their basic assumption the consideration that ‘a document is a possible world’. We propose instead an approach based on a completely different assumption: ‘a term is a possible world’. This approach enables the exploitation of term‐term relationships which are estimated using an information theoretic measure.', 'venue': 'J.

A contex~ consists of two components a cluster of logically related articles (its exrension) and a small set of salient concepts, represented by words and phrases and organized by the cluster’s key terms (its irr~ertsion). At inn-time, the system presents contexts that best match the result list of a user’s natural language query. The user can then choose a context and manipulate the intensionsd component to both browse the context’s extension and launch new searches over the entire database. We argue that the focused relevance feedback provided by contexts, at a level of abstraction higher than individual documents and lower than the database as a whole, provides a natural way for users to refine vague information needs and helps to blur the distinction between searching and browsing. The I%zraphrase interface, running over a database of business-related news articles, is used to illustrate the advantages of such a context-based retrieval paradigm.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 1997, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1723684', 'name': 'Peter G.

As a consequence, they may need to scan multiple result pages or reformulate their queries, which may be a frustrating experience. Alternatively, systems can improve user satisfaction by proactively asking questions of the users to clarify their information needs. Asking clarifying questions is especially important in conversational systems since they can only return a limited number of (often only one) result(s). In this paper, we formulate the task of asking clarifying questions in open-domain information-seeking conversational systems. To this end, we propose an offline evaluation methodology for the task and collect a dataset, called Qulac, through crowdsourcing. Our dataset is built on top of the TREC Web Track 2009-2012 data and consists of over 10K question-answer pairs for 198 TREC topics with 762 facets. Our experiments on an oracle model demonstrate that asking only one good question leads to over 170% retrieval performance improvement in terms of P@1, which clearly demonstrates the potential impact of the task. We further propose a retrieval framework consisting of three components: question retrieval, question selection, and document retrieval. In particular, our question selection model takes into account the original query and previous question-answer interactions while selecting the next question. Our model significantly outperforms competitive baselines. To foster research in this area, we have made Qulac publicly available.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2019, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3390352', 'name': 'Mohammad Aliannejadi'}, {'authorId': '2499986', 'name': 'Hamed Zamani'}, {'authorId': '145876066', 'name': 'F.

We show that using a consistent estimator of texture model parameters for the FE step followed by computing the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between estimated models for the SM step is asymptotically optimal in term of retrieval error probability. The statistical scheme leads to a new wavelet-based texture retrieval method that is based on the accurate modeling of the marginal distribution of wavelet coefficients using generalized Gaussian density (GGD) and on the existence a closed form for the KLD between GGDs. The proposed method provides greater accuracy and flexibility in capturing texture information, while its simplified form has a close resemblance with the existing methods which uses energy distribution in the frequency domain to identify textures.

According to this model, the left and right prefrontal lobes are part of an extensive neuronal network that subserves episodic remembering, but the two prefrontal hemispheres play different roles. Left prefrontal cortical regions are differentially more involved in retrieval of information from semantic memory and in simultaneously encoding novel aspects of the retrieved information into episodic memory.

However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation.

These products have been continuously evaluated and validated, and opportunities for improvements have been noted. We have replaced the surface reflectance assumptions, the set of aerosol model optical properties, and the aerosol lookup table (LUT). This second-generation operational algorithm performs a simultaneous inversion of two visible (0.47 and 0.66 μm) and one shortwave-IR (2.12 μm) channel, making use of the coarse aerosol information content contained in the 2.12 μm channel. Inversion of the three channels yields three nearly independent parameters, the aerosol optical depth (τ) at 0.55 μm, the nondust or fine weighting (η), and the surface reflectance at 2.12 μm. Retrievals of small-magnitude negative τ values (down to −0.05) are considered valid, thus balancing the statistics of τ in near zero τ conditions. Preliminary validation of this algorithm shows much improved retrievals of τ, where the MODIS/Aerosol Robotic Network τ (at 0.55 μm) regression has an equation of: y = 1.01x + 0.03, R = 0.90.

In addition to describing impact indicators for traditional scholarly outputs, such as journal articles and monographs, it also covers indicators for videos, datasets, software and other non-standard scholarly outputs. The book describes strategies to analyse web indicators for individual publications as well as to compare the impacts of groups of publications. The practical part of the book includes descriptions of how to use the free software Webometric Analyst to gather and analyse web data.

The situation has been remedied by development of a new program (Mogul) for automated retrieval of molecular geometry data from the CSD. The program uses a system of keys to encode the chemical environments of fragments (bonds, valence angles, and acyclic torsions) from CSD structures. Fragments with identical keys are deemed to be chemically identical and are grouped together, and the distribution of the appropriate geometrical parameter (bond length, valence angle, or torsion angle) is computed and stored. Use of a search tree indexed on key values, together with a novel similarity calculation, then enables the distribution matching any given query fragment (or the distributions most closely matching, if an adequate exact match is unavailable) to be found easily and with no user intervention. Validation experiments indicate that, with rare exceptions, search results afford precise and unbiased estimates of molecular geometrical preferences. Such estimates may be used, for example, to validate the geometries of libraries of modeled molecules or of newly determined crystal structures or to assist structure solution from low-resolution (e.g. powder diffraction) X-ray data.', 'venue': 'Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling', 'year': 2004, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35885770', 'name': 'I.

The availability of such extensive document resources has created new challenges and opportunities for research. These include improving design information retrieval to achieve a more coherent environment for design exploration, learning, and reuse. One critical issue is related to the construction of a structured representation for indexing design documents that record engineers' ideas and reasoning processes for a specific design. This representation should explicitly and accurately capture the important design concepts as well as the relationships between these concepts so that engineers can locate their documents of interest with less effort. For design information retrieval, we propose to use shallow natural language processing and domain-specific design ontology to automatically construct a structured and semantics-based representation from unstructured design documents. The design concepts and relationships of the representation are recognized from the document based on the identified linguistic patterns. The recognized concepts and relationships are joined to form a concept graph. The integration of these concept graphs builds an application-specific design ontology, which can be seen as the structured representation of the content of the corporate document repository, as well as an automatically populated knowledge base from previous designs. To improve the performance of design information retrieval, we have developed ontology-based query processing, where users' requests are interpreted based on their domain-specific meanings. Our approach contrasts with the traditionally used keyword-based search. An experiment to test the retrieval performance is conducted by using the design documents from a product design scenario. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the keyword-based search techniques.

Problems of semantic heterogeneity caused by the ambiguity of natural language can arise during keyword‐based search in catalogues and when formulating a query to access the discovered data. In this paper, we present an approach to ontology‐based GI retrieval that contributes to solving existing problems of semantic heterogeneity and hides most of the complexity of the required procedure from the requester. A query language and graphical user interface allow a requester to intuitively formulate a query using a well‐known domain vocabulary. From this query, an ontology concept is derived, which is then used to search a catalogue for a data source that provides all the information required to answer the requester's query. If a suitable data source is discovered, the relevant data are accessed through a standardized interface. The approach is implemented through several components that can be used as an extension to standard SDIs.\", 'venue': 'International Journal of Geographical Information Science', 'year': 2006, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145343669', 'name': 'M.

In this paper we consider the situation where no relevance information is available, that is, at the start of the search. Based on a probabilistic model, strategies are proposed for the initial search and an intermediate search. Retrieval experiments with the Cranfield collection of 1,400 documents show that this initial search strategy is better than conventional search strategies both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and in terms of the number of queries that retrieve relevant documents. The intermediate search is shown to be a useful substitute for a relevance feedback search. Experiments with queries that do not retrieve relevant documents at high rank positions indicate that a cluster search would be an effective alternative strategy.', 'venue': 'J.

If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the ``half-way'' point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel.

Systems aimed at effectively managing image data have generally approached the problem from two different views: They either possess a strong database component with little image understanding, or they serve as an image repository for computer vision applications, with little emphasis on the image retrieval process. A general architecture for visual information-management systems (VIMS), which combine the strengths of both approaches, is presented. The system utilizes computer vision routines for both insertion and retrieval and allows easy query-by-example specifications.

This article describes the News-on-Demand application created within the InformediaTM Digital Video Library project and discusses how speech recognition is used for transcript creation from video, time alignment of closed-captioned transcripts, a speech query interface, and audio paragraph segmentation. Our results show that speech recognition accuracy varies dramatically depending on the quality and type of data used, but the system is quite useable with only moderate speech recognition accuracy. 1. What is Informedia: News-on-Demand The InformediaTM digital video library project [Informedia95, Wactlar96] at Carnegie Mellon University is creating a digital library in which text, image, video and audio data are available for full content retrieval. News-on-Demand is an application within Informedia which monitors news from TV, radio and text sources and allows the user to retrieve news stories of interest. This paper gives a brief overview of the Informedia digital video library project [Christel94a, Stevens94, Christel94b, Informedia95] followed by a detailed description of the News-on-Demand application [Hauptmann95]. Both the automated library creation process for News-on-Demand and the news library exploration process will be explained. We show how speech recognition fits into the various digital news library processing steps. Results are presented for speech recognition on actual broadcast news data. Finally we discuss some active areas of research relevant to the multimedia information acquisition and retrieval problem. 1.1 An Overview of the Informedia Digital Video Library Project Vast digital libraries of information will soon become available on the World Wide Web as a result of emerging multimedia computing technologies. However, it is not enough simply to store and play back information as many commercial video-on-demand services apparently intend to do. New technology is needed to organize and search these vast data collections, retrieve the most relevant selections, and permit the to be effectively reused. Through the integration of technologies from the fields of natural language understanding, image processing, speech recognition and video compression, the Informedia project [Christel-94a] allows a user to explore multimedia data in depth as well as in breadth. The Informedia digital video library project goes far beyond the current paradigm of video-on-demand, where a user can Intelligent Multimedia Information Retrieval, Mark T. Maybury, Ed.. AAAI Press, pps. 213-239, 1997. 2 Informedia: News-on-Demand — Multimedia Information Acquisition and Retrieval select one video from a limited set and view that video after a delay of a perhaps a few minutes. The computer adds no substantial benefit to this video-on-demand model over a VCR with each video on a tape; the user remains a passive observer of someone else’s produced material. By contrast, the Informedia Project segments hours of video into logical pieces and indexes these pieces according to their raw content (dialog, images, narration). The users can actively explore the information by finding sections of content relevant to their search, rather than by following someone else’s path through the material (as one does when using the current generation of educational CD-ROMs) or by viewing a large chunk of pre-produced material (as with video on demand). Through the active, dynamic exploration supported by a deep, rich library and the indexing and retrieval capabilities of the computer, the user is more motivated and may learn more from the data set. Using such a library, a large body of video material can be searched with very little effort. Users are able to explore Informedia libraries through an interface that allows them to search using typed or spoken natural language queries, to select relevant documents retrieved from the library and to play or display the material on their PC workstations. The library retrieval system can effectively process natural spoken queries and deliver relevant video data in small video paragraphs, based on information associated with the video during library creation. Video and other data may be explored in depth for related content. During retrieval based on keyword searches by a user, only the query-relevant video segments are displayed. The Informedia project is developing new technologies and embedding them in a video library system primarily for use in education and training. The Informedia project will establish an on-line digital video library consisting of over 1000 hours of video material. In order to be able to process this volume of data, practical, effective and efficient tools are essential. In the United States, schools and industry together spend between $400 and $600 billion per year on education and training, an activity that is 93% labor-intensive, with little change in teacher productivity ratios since the 1800s. The new digital video library technology will bring about a revolutionary improvement in the way education and training are delivered and received. The initial Informedia test-bed system has been installed in a K-12 school, where students use the Informedia System to explore multimedia data for educational purposes. We plan to extend this test-bed to other Pittsburgh schools. During library creation for the test-bed, video material obtained from our Informedia Project Partners such as WQED/Pittsburgh and the British Open University is used. Our project plan calls for four test-bed installations with users ranging from grade school children to university faculty. In addition, we will provide networked access to the primary test bed, and export portions of the system and data to other sites for their local exploration and experimentation. The user tests will be conducted at Carnegie Mellon University, the Winchester Thurston School in Pittsburgh, the Fairfax County (VA.) public school system, and with the Open University in the UK. Users will be of many different types, as we test the practicality of the concept of multimedia library search and the usability of the user interface for various age and interest groups. Universal access to large amounts of low-cost digital information and entertainment will significantly affect the conduct of business, professional, and personal activity. The initial impact of the Informedia project’s activity will be by enabling broad accessibility and reuse of existing Hauptmann and Witbrock 3 video materials (e.g., documentaries, news, vocational, training) previously generated for public broadcast, public and professional education, and vocational, military and business training. 1.2 The Informedia: News-on-Demand Application One compelling application branch of the Informedia project is the indexing and retrieval of television, radio and text news. The Informedia: News-on-Demand application [Hauptmann95] is an innovative example of indexing and searching broadcast news video and news radio material by its text content. News-on-Demand is a fully-automatic system that monitors TV, radio and text news and allows selective retrieval of news stories based on spoken queries. The user may choose among the retrieved stories and play back the news stories of interest. The system runs on a Pentium PC using MPEG-I video compression. Speech recognition is currently done on a separate platform using the Sphinx-II continuous speech recognition system [CMU-Speech95]. The News-on-Demand application forces us to consider the limits of what can be done automatically and in limited time. Since news events happen daily, it is not feasible to process, segment and label news through manual or “human-assisted” methods. Immediate availability of the library information is important, as is continuous updating of the contents. 4 Informedia: News-on-Demand — Multimedia Information Acquisition and Retrieval Digital Compression Text Library Creation', 'venue': '', 'year': 1997, 'authors': [{'authorId': '7661726', 'name': 'Alexander Hauptmann'}, {'authorId': '2819135', 'name': 'M.

As William James so aptly pointed out, “the only proof of there being retention is that recall actually takes place.” (1892). Such a view of memory as remembering is well elaborated in the theoretical reflections of Bergson (1896), in the seminal studies of Bartlett (1932) and later in those of Tulving (Tulving and Thomson 1973) and Craik (1983), who argue, after Bergson, that remembering is an activity similar to perceiving, in the sense that it involves the apprehension and comprehension of contemporary stimuli in the light of past experience. Although some memory retrieval is likely to occur spontaneously as a result of random fluctuations of patterns of neuronal activity, retrieval is usually brought about as a result of integration of incoming environmental information with the “memory network” driven by that information (Tulving and Thomson 1973). It follows from this that retrieval will lead to the formation of new memories made on the background of a retrieved prior experience. Therefore, it is inconceivable that new memory can be acquired independently of retrieval of past experience, in that it is memory of the past, that organizes and provides meaning to the present perceptual experience. Borrowing Tulving’s terminology, new episodic memory, to be remembered in a meaningful way, must be consolidated within a preexisting semantic memory. This analysis does not draw a clear demarcation between consolidation and retrieval processes and in this view, it can be assumed that every retrieval operation should trigger a reconsolidation process (Spear and Mueller 1984). Moreover, decoding or retrieval will change the information content of the “trace” such that memory can be viewed from a neurobiological point of view as an emergent, dynamic, adaptive property of the nervous system. The theoretical emphasis on memory reactivation and reconsolidation made here raises the issue, as yet ill addressed by neurobiological experiments, of factors that control or modulate these processes. We first review the literature dealing with the neurobiological factors that are involved in the actual retrieval process, a literature that was, until recently, relatively sparse. The advent of noninvasive imaging technology applicable to human studies has, however, awakened interest in this topic and has resulted in a proliferation of studies directly dealing with this aspect of memory function. These will be briefly discussed. The second part of this review deals with recent neurobiological evidence for reconsolidation of memories after their reactivation.', 'venue': 'Learning & memory (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)', 'year': 2000, 'authors': [{'authorId': '145393156', 'name': 'S.

Repeated testing enhances learning more than repeated reading, which often confers limited benefit beyond that gained from the initial reading of the material. Laboratory research also suggests that students lack metacognitive awareness of the mnemonic benefits of testing. The implication is that in real-world educational settings students may not engage in retrieval practise to enhance learning. To investigate students’ real-world study behaviours, we surveyed 177 college students and asked them (1) to list strategies they used when studying (an open-ended free report question) and (2) to choose whether they would reread or practise recall after studying a textbook chapter (a forced report question). The results of both questions point to the same conclusion: A majority of students repeatedly read their notes or textbook (despite the limited benefits of this strategy), but relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practise while studying. We propose that many students experience illusions of competence while studying and that these illusions have significant consequences for the strategies students select when they monitor and regulate their own learning.', 'venue': 'Memory', 'year': 2009, 'authors': [{'authorId': '5939440', 'name': 'Jeffrey D.

These latter methods all produce large numbers of small clusters containing just pairs of documents. This finding motivates the work reported in the second part of the paper, which considers the use of clusters consisting of a document together with that document with which it is most similar.

Representative values of this measure are reported here for systems in medical imaging, materials testing, weather forecasting, information retrieval, polygraph lie detection, and aptitude testing.

While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Crucially, ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from millions of documents. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring up to four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.\", 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2020, 'authors': [{'authorId': '144112155', 'name': 'O.

We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from designing, iterating and maintaining a massive recommendation system with enormous user-facing impact.', 'venue': 'ACM Conference on Recommender Systems', 'year': 2016, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2072136504', 'name': 'Paul Covington'}, {'authorId': '150138001', 'name': 'Jay K.

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.', 'venue': 'Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining', 'year': 2002, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1680188', 'name': 'T.

To be viable as a laboratory tool, a collection must reliably rank different retrieval variants according to their true effectiveness. In particular, the relative effectiveness of two retrieval strategies should be insensitive to modest changes in the relevant document set since individual relevance assessments are known to vary widely. The test collections developed in the TREC workshops have become the collections of choice in the retrieval research community. To verify their reliability, NIST investigated the effect changes in the relevance assessments have on the evaluation of retrieval results. Very high correlations were found among the rankings of systems produced using different relevance judgment sets. The high correlations indicate that the comparative evaluation of retrieval performance is stable despite substantial differences in relevance judgments, and thus reaffirm the use of the TREC collections as laboratory tools.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 1998, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1746656', 'name': 'E.

Since text-based information retrieval has been shown to perform very poorly when searching through images, research has been active in the field of content-based image retrieval (CBIR). CBIR systems make use of the properties of images in order to compare them and extract content by matching the query image. Comparing features – such as color, texture, and shape – allows for better retrieval accuracy; however, the algorithms used are still very limited. This paper will provide a survey of CBIR systems and explain the fundamental properties and techniques used in these systems. First, the history of CBIR systems will be discussed together with some typical CBIR systems. After this, the paper will touch on text-based information retrieval and explain why it does not work for searching through collections of images. The latter portion of this document will provides an overview of a typical CBIR system and the main techniques involved in querying such a system.

By sampling from the conditional distributions over each data modality, it is possible to create these representations even when some data modalities are missing. We conduct experiments on bimodal image-text and audio-video data.

Using the climatology of almucantur retrievals from global Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Sun photometer sites, we perform cluster analysis to determine aerosol type as a function of location and season. We find that three spherical-derived types (describing fine-sized dominated aerosol) and one spheroid-derived types (describing coarse-sized dominated aerosol, presumably dust) generally describe the range of AERONET observed global aerosol properties. The fine-dominated types are separated mainly by their single scattering albedo (ω0), ranging from nonabsorbing aerosol (ω0 ∼ 0.95) in developed urban/industrial regions, to moderately absorbing aerosol (ω0 ∼ 0.90) in forest fire burning and developing industrial regions, to absorbing aerosol (ω0 ∼ 0.85) in regions of savanna/grassland burning. We identify the dominant aerosol type at each site, and extrapolate to create seasonal 1° × 1° maps of expected aerosol types. Each aerosol type is bilognormal, with dynamic (function of optical depth) size parameters (radius, standard deviation, volume distribution) and complex refractive index. Not only are these parameters interesting in their own right, they can also be applied to aerosol retrieval algorithms, such as to aerosol retrieval over land from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer.

Learning to rank is useful for document retrieval, collaborative filtering, and many other applications. Several methods for learning to rank have been proposed, which take object pairs as 'instances' in learning. We refer to them as the pairwise approach in this paper. Although the pairwise approach offers advantages, it ignores the fact that ranking is a prediction task on list of objects. The paper postulates that learning to rank should adopt the listwise approach in which lists of objects are used as 'instances' in learning. The paper proposes a new probabilistic method for the approach. Specifically it introduces two probability models, respectively referred to as permutation probability and top k probability, to define a listwise loss function for learning. Neural Network and Gradient Descent are then employed as model and algorithm in the learning method. Experimental results on information retrieval show that the proposed listwise approach performs better than the pairwise approach.\", 'venue': 'International Conference on Machine Learning', 'year': 2007, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2113999576', 'name': 'Zhe Cao'}, {'authorId': '143826491', 'name': 'Tao Qin'}, {'authorId': '2110264337', 'name': 'Tie-Yan Liu'}, {'authorId': '1793168', 'name': 'Ming-Feng Tsai'}, {'authorId': '2145572104', 'name': 'Hang Li'}]}\n",

This paradigm is implemented in practice in the IntelliZap system, where search is initiated from a text query marked by the user in a document she views, and is guided by the text surrounding the marked query in that document (\"the context\"). The context-driven information retrieval process involves semantic keyword extraction and clustering to automatically generate new, augmented queries. The latter are submitted to a host of general and domain-specific search engines. Search results are then semantically reranked, using context.

In particular, the retrieval process during testing may activate elaborative information related to the target response, thereby increasing the chances that activation of any of this information will facilitate later retrieval of the target. In a test of this view, participants learned cue-target pairs, which were strongly associated (e.g., Toast: Bread) or weakly associated (e.g., Basket: Bread), through either a cued recall test (Toast: _____) or a restudy opportunity (Toast: Bread). A final test requiring free recall of the targets revealed that tested items were retained better than restudied items, and although strong cues facilitated recall of tested items initially, items recalled from weak cues were retained better over time, such that this advantage was eliminated or reversed at the time of the final test. Restudied items were retained at similar rates on the final test regardless of the strength of the cue-target relationship. These results indicate that the activation of elaborative information-which would occur to a greater extent during testing than restudying--may be one mechanism that underlies the testing effect.', 'venue': 'Journal of Experimental Psychology.

VIS principles developed include: dynamic query filters (query parameters are rapidly adjusted with sliders, buttons, maps, etc.), starfield displays (two-dimensional scatterplots to structure result sets and zooming to reduce clutter), and tight coupling (interrelating query components to preserve display invariants and support progressive refinement combined with an emphasis on using search output to foster search input).

However, this information can be explicitly combined with face matching score to improve the overall face-recognition accuracy. Moreover, in certain application domains, e.g., visual surveillance, where a face image is occluded or is captured in off-frontal pose, soft biometric traits can provide even more valuable information for face matching or retrieval. Facial marks can also be useful to differentiate identical twins whose global facial appearances are very similar. The similarities found from soft biometrics can also be useful as a source of evidence in courts of law because they are more descriptive than the numerical matching scores generated by a traditional face matcher. We propose to utilize demographic information (e.g., gender and ethnicity) and facial marks (e.g., scars, moles, and freckles) for improving face image matching and retrieval performance. An automatic facial mark detection method has been developed that uses (1) the active appearance model for locating primary facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth), (2) the Laplacian-of-Gaussian blob detection, and (3) morphological operators. Experimental results based on the FERET database (426 images of 213 subjects) and two mugshot databases from the forensic domain (1225 images of 671 subjects and 10 000 images of 10 000 subjects, respectively) show that the use of soft biometric traits is able to improve the face-recognition performance of a state-of-the-art commercial matcher.', 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security', 'year': 2010, 'authors': [{'authorId': '143858687', 'name': 'U.

Satisficing may lead respondents to employ a variety of response strategies, including choosing the first response alternative that seems to constitute a reasonable answer, agreeing with an assertion made by a question, endorsing the status quo instead of endorsing social change, failing to differentiate among a set of diverse objects in ratings, saying ‘don't know’ instead of reporting an opinion, and randomly choosing among the response alternatives offered. This paper specifies a wide range of factors that are likely to encourage satisficing, and reviews relevant evidence evaluating these speculations. Many useful directions for future research are suggested.\", 'venue': '', 'year': 1991, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3799592', 'name': 'J. Krosnick'}]}\n",

To bridge the gap, we lay down the anatomy of a concept-based video search engine. We present a component-wise decomposition of such an interdisciplinary multimedia system, covering influences from information retrieval, computer vision, machine learning, and human–computer interaction. For each of the components we review state-of-the-art solutions in the literature, each having different characteristics and merits. Because of these differences, we cannot understand the progress in video retrieval without serious evaluation efforts such as carried out in the NIST TRECVID benchmark.

Ranking SVM is a typical method of learning to rank. We point out that there are two factors one must consider when applying Ranking SVM, in general a \"learning to rank\" method, to document retrieval. First, correctly ranking documents on the top of the result list is crucial for an Information Retrieval system. One must conduct training in a way that such ranked results are accurate. Second, the number of relevant documents can vary from query to query. One must avoid training a model biased toward queries with a large number of relevant documents. Previously, when existing methods that include Ranking SVM were applied to document retrieval, none of the two factors was taken into consideration. We show it is possible to make modifications in conventional Ranking SVM, so it can be better used for document retrieval. Specifically, we modify the \"Hinge Loss\" function in Ranking SVM to deal with the problems described above. We employ two methods to conduct optimization on the loss function: gradient descent and quadratic programming.

We also show that using global analysis techniques, such as word contezt and phrase structure, on the local aet of documents produces re-sults that are both more effective and more predictable than simple local feedback.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 1996, 'authors': [{'authorId': '2362587', 'name': 'Jinxi Xu'}, {'authorId': '144456145', 'name': 'W.

GMA has all the desirable properties required for cross-view classification and retrieval: it is supervised, it allows generalization to unseen classes, it is multi-view and kernelizable, it affords an efficient eigenvalue based solution and is applicable to any domain. GMA exploits the fact that most popular supervised and unsupervised feature extraction techniques are the solution of a special form of a quadratic constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which can be solved efficiently as a generalized eigenvalue problem. GMA solves a joint, relaxed QCQP over different feature spaces to obtain a single (non)linear subspace. Intuitively, GMA is a supervised extension of Canonical Correlational Analysis (CCA), which is useful for cross-view classification and retrieval. The proposed approach is general and has the potential to replace CCA whenever classification or retrieval is the purpose and label information is available.

Developed from an earlier retrieval that used measurements of radar reflectivity factor together with a priori information about the likely cloud targets, the new retrieval includes temperature information as well to assist in determining the correct region of state space, particularly for those size distribution parameters that are less constrained by the radar measurements. These algorithms have served as the ice cloud retrieval algorithms in Releases 3 and 4 of the CloudSat 2B-CWC-RO Standard Data Product. Several comparison studies have been performed on the previous and current retrieval algorithms: some involving tests of the algorithms on simulated radar data (based on actual cloud probe data or cloud resolving models) and others featuring statistical comparisons of the R04 2B-CWC-RO product (current algorithm) to ice cloud mass retrievals by other spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based instruments or alternative algorithms using the same CloudSat radar data. Comparisons involving simulated radar data based on a database of cloud probe data showed generally good performance, with ice water content (IWC) bias errors estimated to be less than 40%. Comparisons to ice water content and ice water path estimates by other instruments are mixed. When the comparison is restricted to different retrieval approaches using the same CloudSat radar measurements, CloudSat R04 results generally agree with alternative IWC retrievals for IWC < 1000 mg m−3 at altitudes below 12 km but differ at higher ice contents and altitudes, either exceeding other retrievals or falling within a spread of retrieval values.

The significance of interpreting TF-IDF in this way is the potential to: (1) establish a unifying perspective about information retrieval as relevance decision-making; and (2) develop advanced TF-IDF-related term weights for future elaborate retrieval models. Our novel retrieval model is simplified to a basic ranking formula that directly corresponds to the TF-IDF term weights. In general, we show that the term-frequency factor of the ranking formula can be rendered into different term-frequency factors of existing retrieval systems. In the basic ranking formula, the remaining quantity - log p(&rmacr;|t ∈ d) is interpreted as the probability of randomly picking a nonrelevant usage (denoted by &rmacr;) of term t.

Although academic information retrieval researchers have a long history of building and sharing systems, they are primarily designed to facilitate the publication of research papers. As such, these systems are often incomplete, inflexible, poorly documented, difficult to use, and slow, particularly in the context of modern web-scale collections. Furthermore, the growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining open-source systems a constant struggle. However, except for a small number of companies (mostly commercial web search engines) that deploy custom infrastructure, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications. Lucene has an active developer base, a large audience of users, and diverse capabilities to work with heterogeneous collections at scale. However, it lacks systematic support for ad hoc experimentation using standard test collections. We describe Anserini, an information retrieval toolkit built on Lucene that fills this gap. Our goal is to simplify ad hoc experimentation and allow researchers to easily reproduce results with modern bag-of-words ranking models on diverse test collections. With Anserini, we demonstrate that Lucene provides a suitable framework for supporting information retrieval research.

The image is partitioned into non- overlapping tiles of equal size. The color moments and moments on Gabor filter responses of these tiles serve as local descriptors of color and texture respectively. This local information is captured for two resolutions and two grid layouts that provide different details of the same image. An integrated matching scheme, based on most similar highest priority (MSHP) principle and the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph formed using the tiles of query and target image, is provided for matching the images. Shape information is captured in terms of edge images computed using gradient vector flow fields. Invariant moments are then used to record the shape features. The combination of the color, texture and shape features provide a robust feature set for image retrieval.

Methods: Stepwise content analysis of medical images results in six layers of information modeling incorporating medical expert knowledge (raw data layer, registered data layer, feature layer, scheme layer, object layer, knowledge layer). A reference database with 10,000 images categorized according to the image modality, orientation, body region, and biological system is used. By means of prototypes in each category, identification of objects and their geometrical or temporal relationships are handled in the object and the knowledge layer, respectively. A distributed system designed with only three core elements is implemented: (i) the central database holds program sources, processing scheme descriptions, images, features, and administrative information about the workstation cluster; (ii) the scheduler balances distributed computing; and (iii) the web server provides graphical user interfaces for data entry and retrieval, which can be easily adapted to a variety of applications for content-based image retrieval in medicine. Results: Leaving-one-out experiments were distributed by the scheduler and controlled via corresponding job lists offering transparency regarding the viewpoints of a distributed system and the user. The proposed architecture is suitable for content-based image retrieval in medical applications.

They are easy to define if there is a single query and if the retrieval result generated for the query is a linear ordering. However, when the retrieval results are weakly ordered, in the sense that several documents have an identical retrieval status value with respect to a query, some probabilistic notion of precision has to be introduced. Relevance probability, expected precision, and so forth, are some alternatives mentioned in the literature for this purpose. Furthermore, when many queries are to be evaluated and the retrieval results averaged over these queries, some method of interpolation of precision values at certain preselected recall levels is needed. The currently popular approaches for handling both a weak ordering and interpolation are found to be inconsistent, and the results obtained are not easy to interpret. Moreover, in cases where some alternatives are available, no comparative analysis that would facilitate the selection of a particular strategy has been provided. In this paper, we systematically investigate the various problems and issues associated with the use of recall and precision as measures of retrieval system performance.

In particular, the data as to whether the hippocampal region is preferentially involved in the encoding and/or retrieval of associative memory have not allowed for a consensus concerning its specific role. To investigate the role of the hippocampal region and the nearby MTL cortical areas in encoding and retrieval of associative versus non‐associative memories, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity during learning and later recognition testing of novel face‐name pairs. We show that there is greater activity for successful encoding of associative information than for non‐associative information in the right hippocampal region, as well as in the left amygdala and right parahippocampal cortex. Activity for retrieval of associative information was greater than for non‐associative information in the right hippocampal region also, as well as in the left perirhinal cortex, right entorhinal cortex, and right parahippocampal cortex.

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) refers to the retrieval of images from a database using information derived from the images themselves, rather than solely from accompanying text indices. In the medical-imaging context, the ultimate aim of CBIR is to provide radiologists with a diagnostic aid in the form of a display of relevant past cases, along with proven pathology and other suitable information. CBIR may also be useful as a training tool for medical students and residents. The goal of information retrieval is to recall from a database information that is relevant to the user's query. The most challenging aspect of CBIR is the definition of relevance (similarity), which is used to guide the retrieval machine. In this paper, we pursue a new approach, in which similarity is learned from training examples provided by human observers. Specifically, we explore the use of neural networks and support vector machines to predict the user's notion of similarity. Within this framework we propose using a hierarchal learning approach, which consists of a cascade of a binary classifier and a regression module to optimize retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We also explore how to incorporate online human interaction to achieve relevance feedback in this learning framework. Our experiments are based on a database consisting of 76 mammograms, all of which contain clustered microcalcifications (MCs). Our goal is to retrieve mammogram images containing similar MC clusters to that in a query. The performance of the retrieval system is evaluated using precision-recall curves computed using a cross-validation procedure. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the learning framework can accurately predict the perceptual similarity reported by human observers, thereby serving as a basis for CBIR; 2) the learning-based framework can significantly outperform a simple distance-based similarity metric; 3) the use of the hierarchical two-stage network can improve retrieval performance; and 4) relevance feedback can be effectively incorporated into this learning framework to achieve improvement in retrieval precision based on online interaction with users; and 5) the retrieved images by the network can have predicting value for the disease condition of the query.\", 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging', 'year': 2004, 'authors': [{'authorId': '11895669', 'name': 'I.

The framework differentiates with traditional distance metric learning methods in the following ways. 1) A ranking-based distance metric learning method is proposed for image retrieval problem, by optimizing the leave-one-out retrieval performance on the training data. 2) To be scalable, millions of images together with rich textual information have been crawled from the Web to learn the similarity measure, and the learning framework particularly considers the indexing problem to ensure the retrieval efficiency. 3) To alleviate the noises in the unbalanced labels of images and fully utilize the textual information, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation based topic-level text model is introduced to define pairwise semantic similarity between any two images. The learnt distance measure can be directly applied to applications such as content-based image retrieval and search-based image annotation.

However, recent accounts have suggested that negative priming does not reflect inhibitory mechanisms.

In contrast, it is proposed that there is no firm evidence to discount inhibition models.

The latter reduces the diversity and complementariness of documents considered for the fusion, as a consequence the performance of the fusion approach is poor.\\n In this paper we study the combination of multiple heterogeneous methods for image retrieval in annotated collections. Heterogeneousness is considered in terms of i) the modality in which the methods are based on, ii) in the information they use for indexing/querying and iii) in the individual performance of the methods. Different settings for the fusion are considered including weighted, global, per-modality and hierarchical. We report experimental results, in an image retrieval benchmark, that show that the proposed combination outperforms significantly any of the individual methods we consider. Retrieval performance is comparable to the best performance obtained in the context of ImageCLEF2007. An interesting result is that even methods that perform poor (individually) resulted very useful to the fusion strategy.

However, myriad structured information about real-world objects is embedded in static Web pages and online Web databases. Document-level information retrieval can unfortunately lead to highly inaccurate relevance ranking in answering object-oriented queries. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift to enable searching at the object level. In traditional information retrieval models, documents are taken as the retrieval units and the content of a document is considered reliable. However, this reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context when multiple copies of information about the same object typically exist. These copies may be inconsistent because of diversity of Web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques. If we simply combine the noisy and inaccurate attribute information extracted from different sources, we may not be able to achieve satisfactory retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose several language models for Web object retrieval, namely an unstructured object retrieval model, a structured object retrieval model, and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features. We test these models on a paper search engine and compare their performances.

A formal analysis for profile retrieval is developed which is independent of the nature of the retrieval method, provided that the measurement process can be characterized adequately. The relationship between the retrieved and true profiles is expressed in terms of a smoothing function which can be straightforwardly calculated. The retrieval error separates naturally into three components, (1) random error due to measurement noise, (2) systematic error due to uncertain model parameters and inverse model bias, and (3) null-space error due to the inherent finite vertical resolution of the observing system. A recipe is given for evaluating each of the components in any particular case. Most of the error terms appear as covariance matrices, rather than simple error variances. These matrices can be interpreted in terms of “error patterns”, which are statistically independent contributions to the total error. They are the multidimensional equivalent of “error bars”.

The key to maintaining such access is to use that information: The act retrieving an item from memory facilitates subsequent retrieval access to that item. The most efficient scheduling of such \"retrieval practice\" is in terms of an expanding sequence, as shown by Landauer and Bjork (1978). As a mnemonic technique, expanding retrieva1 practice has a number of practical advantages, and the non-semantic nature of that technique has implications re the nature of storage in and retrieval from human memory. RETRIEVAL PRACTICE AND THE MAINTENANCE OF KNOWLEDGE 2 Recently, a research psychologist for the United States Army told me that the Army is increasingly concerned with the \"retention and maintenance of critical skills and knowledge.\" It is one thing to carry out training until some performance criterion is reached; it is another to structure training and post-training experience to insure that performance is maintained over time. The real problem, of course, is keeping. information retrievable. Knowledge, once successfully integrated into long-term memory, tends to remain there, but as time goes on and/or contexts change, we are frequently unable to access some knowledge that was readily accessible to us at some earlier point. When that knowledge is necessary to solve some real-world problem, it is often not recallable, though a recognition or cuing procedure would usually reveal that the \"missing\" information exists in memory (e.g., Bahrick, Bahrick, & Wittlinger, 1975; Wagenaar, 1986). RETRIEVAL AS A MEMORY MODIFIER One key to maintaining access to knowledge in memory is to use--that is, retrieve--that information periodically. In contrast to other memory systems, such as a tape recorder or the memory in a computer, where retrieving stored information does not alter the state of that information in memory, human memory is altered in significant ways by an act of retrieval: The retrieved information becomes more retrievable in the future than it would have been without such an act of retrieval, and certain related items of information in memory may become less retrievable (e.g., Bjork, 1975; Roediger & Neely, 1982). It is not my goal here to discuss the empirical or theoretical deta1ls of such effects. Rather, I want to focus on retrieval practice as a mnemonic technique. Basic Results. Assume a situation where one is presented with an initial opportunity to store some information in memory. That information might be relatively simple, like a name, number, or foreign vocabulary item--or more complex, like a chapter in a book. Assume further that at some later point (Tl), one attempts to retrieve that information. That attempt might be successful or unsuccessful, but assume there is no external feedback as to whether what one recalled, if anything, was correct or incorrect. Now assume that at some still later point (T2) there is a second/test of our ability to recall that same information. To the extent that performance on the second test exceeds performance in the case where there was no first test, we can say that the first test was valuable as a learning (memory enhancing) event. The empirical facts of importance for present purposes are the following. (a) In general, without considering whether the effort to retrieve at Tl was successful or not, performance at T2 profits substantially from the existence of a first test. Under some circumstances such positive effects of a first test on a second test, unconditional on the outcome of the first test, can exceed the positive effects (on performance at time T2) of a second study opportunity presented at time Tl. (c) Failure to retrieve the item correctly at Tl, however, does not help recall at T2. The probability of successful recall at T2 given a failure to recall at Tl is typically very close to zero. A Retrieval-Practice Interpretation. Given that an initial act of retrieval facilitates a later effort to retrieve, it remains to specify the mechanisms through which that facilitation takes place. The idea I want to push here is that an initial retrieval aids a later retrieval to the extent RETRIEVAL PRACTICE AND THE MAINTENANCE OF KNOWLEDGE 3 that it constitutes practice for that later retrieval--that is, to the extent that the processes involved in the initial retrieval overlap the processes required to retrieve that item later. Retrieval of information from long-term memory is a complex, highly fallible aspect of human memory. As such \\\\it is a kind of skill, and like other skills, can profit greatly from practice. A central assumption of the retrieval-practice idea is that an act of retrieval does not simply strengthen an item\\'s representation in memory, but, rather, enhances some aspect of the retrieval process per se. Among the considerations supporting that assumption are the following. (a) If an initial retrieval simply strengthened an item\\'s representation in memory, one might expect that an initial test of recall might facilitate a later test of recognition as much as it does a later test of recall. Typically, however, the effects of an initial recall test on a later recognition test are far less than on a later recall. (b) If, on the other hand, one makes a later recognition test more difficult in ways that might be viewed as making that recognition test more recall-like, then the positive effects of an initial recall test are much larger (Gelfand, Bjork, & Kovacs, 1983). (c) Similarly, as Whitten and Leonard (1980) have shown, as one makes an initial test of recognition more difficult, and recall-like, by increasing the alternatives on an initial forced-choice test, performance on that test decreases but later recall increases. The effects of delaying a first test on performance on a second test also support the retrieval practice interpretation. As we delay the first test, P(Tl), the probability of successful recall at the time of the first test, decreases. Because failure to recall at Tl does not help performance at T2 (i.e., P(T2 given not Tl) equals zero), we might expect that the positive effects of a test at Tl on performance at T2 (given a fixed interval from Tl to T2) would decrease. In fact, real data often show a strong increase in performance at T2 as Tl is delayed from essentially zero to some moderate interval, even though performance at Tl shows a strong drop over that range. The implication of such delay-of-test effects can be seen most clearly in terms of elementary probability theory. The probability of correct recall at T2, P(T2), can be partitioned into P(T2) = P(T2 given Tl) P(Tl) + P(T2 given not Tl) P(not Tl),', 'venue': '', 'year': 1988, 'authors': [{'authorId': '35641166', 'name': 'R.

According to this hypothesis, the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex (areas 46 and 9) is a specialized system for the monitoring and manipulation of information within working memory, whereas the mid-ventrolateral frontal cortex (areas 47/12 and 45) is involved in the active retrieval of information from the posterior cortical association areas. Data are presented which support this two-level hypothesis that posits two distinct levels of interaction of the lateral frontal cortex with posterior cortical association areas. Functional activation studies with normal human subjects have demonstrated specific activity within the mid-dorsolateral region of the frontal cortex during the performance of tasks requiring monitoring of self-generated and externally generated sequences of responses. In the monkey, lesions restricted to this region of the frontal cortex yield a severe impairment in performance of the above tasks, this impairment appearing against a background of normal performance on several basic mnemonic tasks. By contrast, a more severe impairment follows damage to the mid-ventrolateral frontal region and functional activation studies have demonstrated specific changes in activity in this region in relation to the active retrieval of information from memory.', 'venue': 'Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Our approach is similar to the one proposed by Hearst[l2]. Next, we investigate a completely automatic method that makes use of term cooccurrence information to estimate word correlation. Experimental results show that refining the set of documents used in query expansion often prevents the query drift caused by blind expansion and yields substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness, both in terms of average precision and precision in the top twenty documents.

We present two stemming algorithms for Arabic information retrieval systems. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of surface-based retrieval. This approach degrades retrieval precision since Arabic is a highly inflected language. Accordingly, we propose root-based retrieval. We notice a statistically significant improvement over the surface-based approach. Many variant word senses are based on an identical root; thus, the root-based algorithm creates invalid conflation classes that result in an ambiguous query which degrades the performance by adding extraneous terms. To resolve ambiguity, we propose a novel light-stemming algorithm for Arabic texts. This automatic rule-based stemming algorithm is not as aggressive as the root extraction algorithm. We show that the light stemming algorithm significantly outperforms the root-based algorithm.

I argue here that the link between the encoding-retrieval match and retention, although generally positive, is essentially correlational rather than causal—much like the link between deep/elaborative processing and retention. Empirically, increasing the functional match between a cue and a target trace can improve, have no effect, or even decrease retention performance depending on the circumstance.

In this paper we describe our first successful application of these ideas to an information retrieval application, specifically the indexing and retrieval of captions describing the content of images.

We propose two techniques to address the problem. One is to use phrase information in the collection selection index and the other is query expansion. Both techniques enhance the discriminatory power of typical queries for choosing the right collections and hence significantly improve retrieval results.

I will further argue that what we know about the many variables that have been found to affect relevance assessments under experimental conditions, as well as our new understanding of psychological, situational, user‐based relevance, point to a single conclusion. We can no longer rest the evaluation of information retrieval systems on the assumption that such variations do not significantly affect the measurement of information retrieval performance. A series of thorough, rigorous, and extensive tests is needed, of precisely how, and under what conditions, variations in relevance assessments do, and do not, affect measures of retrieval performance.

Documents were judged with respect to the subtopics, as well as with respect to the topic as a whole.

Experiment 4 shows that reliance on the ease of retrieval heuristic resulted in faster judgments than reliance on content, with the former but not the latter being a function of the amount of activated information.\", 'venue': 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology', 'year': 2003, 'authors': [{'authorId': '33879246', 'name': 'Markus Ruder'}, {'authorId': '47368435', 'name': 'H.

The problem with about is that it is a very complex notion and we are unable to say precisely what it is we do when we make judgment of aboutness. Since about is at the heart of indexing, how are we to formulate any proper theory of indexing if we cannot explicate precisely the key concept of about? In this paper we look at this concept of about and offer a solution to the problem mentioned; it consists of an operational definition of about which interprets about in terms of search behavior. \\n \\n \\n \\nA second objective of this paper is to show that about is, in fact, not the central concept in a theory of document retrieval. A document retrieval system ought to provide a ranked output (in response to a search query) not according to the degree that they are about the topic sought by the inquiring patron, but rather according to the probability that they will satisfy that person's information need.

We discuss a technique of integrating color information with spatial knowledge to obtain an overall impression of the image. The technique involves three steps: the selection of a set of representative colors, the analysis of spatial information of the selected colors, and the retrieval process based on the integrated color-spatial information. Two color histograms are used to aid in the process of color selection. After deriving the set of representative colors, spatial knowledge of the selected colors is obtained using a maximum entropy discretization with event covering method. A retrieval process is formulated to make use of the spatial knowledge to retrieve relevant images. A prototype image retrieval system has been implemented on the Unix system.

Over the last several decades, we have developed a modern science and technology for information retrieval, relentlessly pursuing the vision of a \"memex\" that Vannevar Bush proposed in his seminal article, \"As We May Think.\" Faceted search plays a key role in this program. Faceted search addresses weaknesses of conventional search approaches and has emerged as a foundation for interactive information retrieval. User studies demonstrate that faceted search provides more effective information-seeking support to users than best-first search. Indeed, faceted search has become increasingly prevalent in online information access systems, particularly for e-commerce and site search. In this lecture, we explore the history, theory, and practice of faceted search. Although we cannot hope to be exhaustive, our aim is to provide sufficient depth and breadth to offer a useful resource to both researchers and practitioners. Because faceted search is an area of interest to computer scientists, information scientists, interface designers, and usability researchers, we do not assume that the reader is a specialist in any of these fields. Rather, we offer a self-contained treatment of the topic, with an extensive bibliography for those who would like to pursue particular aspects in more depth. Table of Contents: I.

It has been argued that the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 47/12 and 45) is involved in the active retrieval of information from posterior cortical association areas. Active retrieval is required when stimuli in memory do not bear stable relations to each other and therefore retrieval cannot be automatically driven by strong, stable, and unambiguous stimulus or context relations. Data from functional activation studies with normal human subjects are presented that have demonstrated specific changes in activity within the mid-ventrolateral region of the frontal cortex in relation to the active retrieval of information from memory. By contrast, increases in activity in the mid-dorsolateral region of the frontal cortex occur when the performance of the tasks requires monitoring of information in memory.', 'venue': 'Neurobiology of Learning and Memory', 'year': 2002, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1915533', 'name': 'M.

This suggests that retrieval is dynamic and serves to incorporate new information into preexisting memories. However, little is known about whether or not protein degradation is involved in the reorganization of retrieved memory. We found that postsynaptic proteins were degraded in the hippocampus by polyubiquitination after retrieval of contextual fear memory. Moreover, the infusion of proteasome inhibitor into the CA1 region immediately after retrieval prevented anisomycin-induced memory impairment, as well as the extinction of fear memory. This suggests that ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent protein degradation underlies destabilization processes after fear memory retrieval. It also provides strong evidence for the existence of reorganization processes whereby preexisting memory is disrupted by protein degradation, and updated memory is reconsolidated by protein synthesis.', 'venue': 'Science', 'year': 2008, 'authors': [{'authorId': '48602069', 'name': 'Sue-Hyun Lee'}, {'authorId': '7629432', 'name': 'Jun-Hyeok Choi'}, {'authorId': '6770795', 'name': 'Nuribalhae Lee'}, {'authorId': '121406318', 'name': 'Hye-Ryeon Lee'}, {'authorId': '2866915', 'name': 'Jae-Ick Kim'}, {'authorId': '5562616', 'name': 'Nam-Kyung Yu'}, {'authorId': '6550580', 'name': 'Sun-Lim Choi'}, {'authorId': '2171608463', 'name': 'Seung-Hee Lee'}, {'authorId': '2118027470', 'name': 'Hyoung F.

In this article we first evaluate • the evidence and conclude that, contrary to apparent popular belief, the evidence in no way confirms the view that all memories are permanent and thus poten- tially recoverable.

Despite the prevalence of the phenomenon, the factors that underlie forgetting have proved to be rather elusive, and the literature abounds with hypothesized mechanisms to account for the ob- served data. In this article we shall focus our attention on what is perhaps the fundamental issue concerning forgetting; Does forgetting consist of an actual loss of stored information, or does it result from a loss of access to information, which, once stored, remains forever? It should be noted at the outset that this ques- tion may be impossible to resolve in an absolute sense. Consider the following thought experiment.

However, new and emerging access tasks now demand alternative evaluation measures which go beyond this traditional view. A retrieval system provides a means of gaining access to documents, therefore intuitively, our view of the collection is shaped by the retrieval system. In this paper, we outline some emerging information access related scenarios that require knowledge about how the retrieval system affects the users' ability to access information. This provides the motivation for the proposed evaluation measures and methodology where the focus is on capturing the behavior of the system, in terms of how retrievable it makes individual documents within the collection. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods, we perform an extensive analysis on two TREC collections showing how the measures can be applied to evaluate different information access questions. For higher order information access tasks that are inherently dependent on retrievability, our novel evaluation methodology emphasizes that effectiveness is an insufficient characterization of a retrieval system. This paper provides the foundations for the evaluation of higher order access related tasks.\", 'venue': 'International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management', 'year': 2008, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1716332', 'name': 'L.

For that goal, the probability ranking principle, which ranks documents in decreasing order of probability of relevance, is provably optimal. However, there are many scenarios in which that ranking does not optimize for the users information need. One example is when the user would be satisfied with some limited number of relevant documents, rather than needing all relevant documents. We show that in such a scenario, an attempt to return many relevant documents can actually reduce the chances of finding any relevant documents. We consider a number of information retrieval metrics from the literature, including the rank of the first relevant result, the %no metric that penalizes a system only for retrieving no relevant results near the top, and the diversity of retrieved results when queries have multiple interpretations. We observe that given a probabilistic model of relevance, it is appropriate to rank so as to directly optimize these metrics in expectation. While doing so may be computationally intractable, we show that a simple greedy optimization algorithm that approximately optimizes the given objectives produces rankings for TREC queries that outperform the standard approach based on the probability ranking principle.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2006, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3152698', 'name': 'Harr Chen'}, {'authorId': '1743286', 'name': 'David R Karger'}]}\n",

The MediaMill team participated in three tasks: concept detection, automatic search, and interac- tive search. Rather than continuing to increase the number of concept detectors available for retrieval, our TRECVID 2008 experiments focus on increasing the robustness of a small set of detectors using a bag-of-words approach. To that end, our concept detection experiments emphasize in particular the role of visual sampling, the value of color in- variant features, the influence of codebook construction, and the effectiveness of kernel-based learning parameters. For retrieval, a robust but limited set of concept detectors ne- cessitates the need to rely on as many auxiliary information channels as possible. Therefore, our automatic search ex- periments focus on predicting which information channel to trust given a certain topic, leading to a novel framework for predictive video retrieval. To improve the video retrieval re- sults further, our interactive search experiments investigate the roles of visualizing preview results for a certain browse- dimension and active learning mechanisms that learn to solve complex search topics by analysis from user brows- ing behavior. The 2008 edition of the TRECVID bench- mark has been the most successful MediaMill participation to date, resulting in the top ranking for both concept de- tection and interactive search, and a runner-up ranking for automatic retrieval.

In order to move the Web from a data repository to an information resource, a totally new way of organizing information is needed. The advent of the Semantic Web promises better retrieval methods by incorporating the data's semantics and exploiting the semantics during the search process. Such a development needs special attention from the geospatial perspective so that the particularities of geospatial meaning are captured appropriately. The creation the Semantic Geospatial Web needs the development multiple spatial and terminological ontologies, each with a formal semantics; the representation of those semantics such that they are available both to machines for processing and to people for understanding; and the processing of geospatial queries against these ontologies and the evaluation of the retrieval results based on the match between the semantics of the expressed information need and the available semantics of the information resources and search systems. This will lead to a new framework for geospatial information retrieval based on the semantics of spatial and terminological ontologies. By explicitly representing the role of semantics in different components of the information retrieval process (people, interfaces, search systems, and information resources), the Semantic Geospatial Web will enable users to retrieve more precisely the data they need, based on the semantics associated with these data.\", 'venue': 'ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Advances in Geographic Information Systems', 'year': 2002, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1718059', 'name': 'M.

To investigate this issue, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess prefrontal activation during encoding and retrieval of pictures of objects. Responses to studied and unstudied objects at retrieval were compared between two tests with differing demands for the specificity of information to be retrieved (source vs old-new recognition). Results showed that bilateral ventral [Brodmann's areas (BA) 44, 45, and 47] and right dorsal (BA 9) prefrontal regions were activated during both encoding and retrieval, but activity in these regions was not reliably modulated by the specificity of information to be retrieved. A region in left anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 10/46) was reliably activated during retrieval trials, and activation in this region increased with demands to retrieve perceptually detailed information about studied objects. Our results show that left anterior prefrontal cortex is engaged during the monitoring and evaluation of specific memory characteristics at retrieval-a process critical for accurate episodic remembering.\", 'venue': 'Journal of Neuroscience', 'year': 2000, 'authors': [{'authorId': '3119221', 'name': 'C.

Past research is then contrasted with the dimensions and shown not to cover the dimensions sufficiently. Based on an analysis of the goals of information seeking research, and a view on human task performance augmentation, it is then shown that information seeking is intimately associated with, and dependent on, other aspects of work; tasks and technology included.

In contrast, programs that filter text streams, software that categorizes documents, agents which alert users, and many other IR systems must make decisions without human input or supervision. It is important to define what constitutes good effectiveness for these autonomous systems, tune the systems to achieve the highest possible effectiveness, and estimate how the effectiveness changes as new data is processed. We show how to do this for binary text classification systems, emphasizing that different goals for the system le ad to different optimal behaviors. Optimizing and estimating effectiveness is greatly aided if classifiers that explicitly estimate the probability of class membership are used. Ranked retrieval is the information retrieval (IR) researc her’s favorite tool for dealing with information overload. Ranked retrieval systems display documents in order of probability of releva nce or some similar measure. Users see the best documents first, anddecide how far down the ranking to go in examining the available information. The central role played by ranking in this appr oach has led researchers to evaluate IR systems primarily, often exclusively, on the quality of their rankings. (See, for instance , the TREC evaluations [1].) In some IR applications, however, ranking is not enough: A company provides an SDI (selective dissemination of information) service which filters newswire feeds. Relevant articles are faxed each morning to clients. Interaction between customer and system takes place infrequently. The cost of resources (tying up phone lines, fax machine paper, etc.) is a factor to consider in operating the system.

The earlier article examined studies of information retrieval system searching for their implications for online catalog design; this article examines the implications of card catalog design for online catalogs. With this analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of user behavior and to lay to rest the card catalog design model for online catalogs. We discuss the problems with query matching systems, which were designed for skilled search intermediaries rather than end‐users, and the knowledge and skills they require in the information‐seeking process, illustrated with examples of searching card and online catalogs. Searching requires conceptual knowledge of the information retrieval process—translating an information need into a searchable query; semantic knowledge of how to implement a query in a given system—the how and when to use system features; and technical skills in executing the query—basic computing skills and the syntax of entering queries as specific search statements. In the short term, we can help make online catalogs easier to use through improved training and documentation that is based on information‐seeking behavior, with the caveat that good training is not a substitute for good system design. Our long term goal should be to design intuitive systems that require a minimum of instruction. Given the complexity of the information retrieval problem and the limited capabilities of today's systems, we are far from achieving that goal. If libraries are to provide primary information services for the networked world, they need to put research results on the information‐seeking process into practice in designing the next generation of online public access information retrieval systems. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\", 'venue': 'Journal of the American Society for Information Science', 'year': 1996, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1696082', 'name': 'C.

Findings from studies of encoding indicate that, at the cortical level, the regions responsible for the effective encoding of a stimulus event as an episodic memory include some of the regions that are also engaged to process the event 'online'. Thus, it appears that there is no single cortical site or circuit responsible for episodic encoding. The results of retrieval studies indicate that successful recollection of episodic information is associated with activation of lateral parietal cortex, along with more variable patterns of activity in dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex. Whereas parietal regions may play a part in the representation of retrieved information, prefrontal areas appear to support processes that act on the products of retrieval to align behaviour with the demands of the retrieval task.\", 'venue': 'Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This paper reports the results of experiments designed to determine the validity of an approach to the automatic construction of global thesauri (described originally by Crouch in [1] and [2] based on a clustering of the document collection. The authors validate the approach by showing that the use of thesauri generated by this method results in substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness in four test collections. The term discrimination value theory, used in the thesaurus generation algorithm to determine a term's membership in a particular thesaurus class, is found not to be useful in distinguishing a “good” from an “indifferent” or “poor” thesaurus class). In conclusion, the authors suggest an alternate approach to automatic thesaurus construction which greatly simplifies the work of producing viable thesaurus classes. Experimental results show that the alternate approach described herein in some cases produces thesauri which are comparable in retrieval effectiveness to those produced by the first method at much lower cost.\", 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 1992, 'authors': [{'authorId': '1690470', 'name': 'C.

Distributed searching is cast in three parts — database selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval performance. We look at retrieval performance in three different distributed retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database. Second we find that good performance can be achieved when only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local information can be used to achieve superior performance. This means that distributed systems can be engineered with more autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that improvements in database selection can lead to broader improvements in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good selection mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selection step.', 'venue': 'Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'year': 2000, 'authors': [{'authorId': '33968184', 'name': 'Allison L.
